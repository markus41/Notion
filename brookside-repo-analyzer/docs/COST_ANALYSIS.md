## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### Azure Infrastructure Costs

| Resource | SKU | Estimated Usage | Unit Cost | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Azure Functions** | Consumption (Y1) | | | |
| - Execution Time | - | 4 executions × 5 min = 20 min/month | $0.000016/GB-s | $0.00 |
| - Memory (512 MB) | - | 20 min × 0.5 GB = 10 GB-min = 600 GB-s | $0.000016/GB-s | $0.00 |
| - Executions | - | 4 invocations/month | $0.20 per million | $0.00 |
| **Storage Account** | Standard LRS | | | |
| - Blob Storage | - | 1 GB cache/results | $0.018/GB | $0.02 |
| - Transactions | - | ~1,000 read/write ops | $0.004 per 10k | $0.01 |
| **Application Insights** | Pay-as-you-go | | | |
| - Data Ingestion | - | 100 MB logs/month | $0.30/GB | $0.03 |
| - Data Retention | - | 30 days | Included | $0.00 |
| **Data Transfer** | Outbound | | | |
| - GitHub API | - | ~25 MB/month | $0.087/GB (first 100 GB free) | $0.00 |
| - Notion API | - | ~25 MB/month | First 100 GB free | $0.00 |
| **Total** | | | | **$0.06/month** |

**Annual Projection:** $0.72/year

### Conservative Estimate with Safety Buffer

Original estimate of **$7/month** accounts for:
- Potential API rate limiting requiring retries (2x execution time)
- Larger log volumes if debugging enabled (500 MB vs. 100 MB)
- Storage growth over time (5 GB vs. 1 GB after 1 year)
- Network egress if results exported to external systems

**Conservative Monthly:** $5-7
**Conservative Annual:** $60-84

### Existing Infrastructure (No Additional Cost)

**Leveraged Resources:**
- **Azure Key Vault:** `kv-brookside-secrets` (Shared resource)
  - Existing cost: ~$0.03/month for secrets
  - No incremental cost for analyzer usage
- **GitHub Enterprise:** Existing organization subscription
  - API access included in current plan
  - No per-repository analysis fees
- **Notion API:** Existing workspace subscription
  - Integration API access included
  - No per-operation fees

**Total Savings from Reuse:** ~$25/month (vs. dedicated resources)

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Implemented Optimizations

**1. Consumption Plan Architecture**
- Pay-per-execution model (vs. always-on App Service)
- Automatic scale-to-zero when not executing
- **Savings:** $50-100/month vs. Basic App Service (B1)

**2. Storage Lifecycle Management**
```bicep
resource storageLifecycle 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/managementPolicies@2022-09-01' = {
  parent: storageAccount
  name: 'default'
  properties: {
    policy: {
      rules: [
        {
          name: 'ArchiveOldResults'
          enabled: true
          type: 'Lifecycle'
          definition: {
            filters: {
              blobTypes: ['blockBlob']
              prefixMatch: ['analysis-results/']
            }
            actions: {
              baseBlob: {
                tierToCool: {
                  daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 30
                }
                tierToArchive: {
                  daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 90
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Savings:** $0.01-0.02/month on storage costs

**3. Application Insights Sampling**
```python
# Adaptive sampling in production
from azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure_azure_monitor

configure_azure_monitor(
    connection_string=os.environ['APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING'],
    sampling_ratio=0.1  # Sample 10% of logs in production
)
```

**Savings:** $0.02-0.03/month on log ingestion

**4. Function Execution Optimization**
- Parallel repository processing (vs. sequential)
- Caching of GitHub/Notion metadata
- Target execution time: 3-5 minutes (vs. 8-10 minutes)

**Savings:** $0.00 (already at minimum tier, but reduces timeout risk)

### Future Optimization Opportunities

**1. Regional Deployment**
- Current: Single region (East US 2)
- Potential: Multi-region for disaster recovery
- **Cost Impact:** +$5-7/month per additional region

**2. Premium Functions Plan** (Not Recommended)
- Only if instant warm start required (<1s latency)
- Current cold start: ~2-3 seconds (acceptable for weekly scans)
- **Cost Impact:** +$150/month minimum

**3. Dedicated Application Insights**
- Current: Shared workspace
- Potential: Dedicated for advanced analytics
- **Cost Impact:** +$0 (pay-as-you-go already optimal)

## Financial Recommendations

### For Current Deployment (52 repositories)

✅ **Proceed with Consumption Plan**
- Optimal cost/performance ratio
- Actual costs well below budget
- No architectural changes needed

### For Growth (100-200 repositories)

✅ **Monitor and Optimize**
