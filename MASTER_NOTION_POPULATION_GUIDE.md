3. **Verify relations** - Check bi-directional links work correctly
4. **Test search** - Ensure discoverability after each phase
5. **Take breaks** - Batch creation can be tedious, avoid burnout
6. **Celebrate milestones** - Mark each phase complete, recognize progress
7. **Document issues** - Note any problems for future improvement
8. **Get team input** - Validate descriptions and categorizations
9. **Keep specs open** - Reference documents in second monitor/screen
10. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Speed up Notion navigation

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Cost rollups not displaying**:
- Verify Software Tracker entries have numeric Cost field
- Check relations established from Software ‚Üí Build (not Build ‚Üí Software)
- Ensure rollup formula type is "sum" for Total Monthly Cost

**Notion MCP won't reconnect**:
- Restart Claude Code to trigger OAuth flow
- Check `.claude/settings.local.json` has correct config
- Verify browser authentication completed
- Run `claude mcp list` to check status

**Relations not working**:
- Ensure both databases have relation property
- Check property names match exactly
- Verify you're linking to correct database ID
- Test bi-directional visibility

**Search not finding entries**:
- Check entry titles match expected format
- Verify tags are applied correctly
- Ensure entries are not in "Private" mode
- Refresh Notion cache (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
