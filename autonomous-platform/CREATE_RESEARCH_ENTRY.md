## Alternative: Use Notion MCP to Create Entry Programmatically

If you prefer to use Claude Code with Notion MCP to create this entry:

```bash
# In Claude Code conversation:
"Please create a Research Hub entry using Notion MCP for the Autonomous Workflow
Viability Research. Use the specification in
.claude/templates/research-hub-entry-template.md and the content from
.claude/docs/research-autonomous-workflow-viability.md"
```

Claude Code will:
1. Read the template and content files
2. Use Notion MCP to create the entry
3. Set all properties correctly
4. Add all content sections
5. Create proper relations
6. Verify creation success

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find Origin Idea
**Solution:** Create the Idea entry first, then return to research entry and link it.

### Issue: Software Tracker entries missing
**Solution:** Create missing software entries with appropriate costs and categories, then link to research.

### Issue: Viability scores not calculating
**Solution:** Ensure Composite Viability Score is a Number property (not Formula). Enter 92 manually.

### Issue: Relations not showing
**Solution:** Verify database IDs are correct. Use Notion's relation property search to find correct entries.

### Issue: Content too long to paste
**Solution:** Copy content in sections. Start with major headings, then add subsections progressively.

**Manual Creation:**
- Properties and relations: 10 minutes
- Content copying and formatting: 30-45 minutes
- Verification and updates: 10 minutes
- **Total: 50-65 minutes**

**Using Notion MCP (Automated):**
