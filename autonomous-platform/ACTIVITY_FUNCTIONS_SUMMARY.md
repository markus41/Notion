## Activity Function Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Execution (BuildPipelineOrchestrator)

```javascript
// Stage 1: Architecture
const architecture = yield context.df.callActivity('InvokeClaudeAgent', {...});

// Stage 2: Code Generation
const codebase = yield context.df.callActivity('GenerateCodebase', {...});

// Stage 3: GitHub
const repo = yield context.df.callActivity('CreateGitHubRepository', {...});

// Stage 4: Deploy
const deployment = yield context.df.callActivity('DeployToAzure', {...});

// Stage 5: Validate
const validation = yield context.df.callActivity('ValidateDeployment', {...});

// Stage 6: Learn
yield context.df.callActivity('LearnPatterns', {...});
```

### Parallel Execution (ResearchSwarmOrchestrator)

```javascript
const researchTasks = [
  context.df.callActivity('InvokeClaudeAgent', { agent: 'market-researcher', ... }),
  context.df.callActivity('InvokeClaudeAgent', { agent: 'technical-analyst', ... }),
  context.df.callActivity('InvokeClaudeAgent', { agent: 'cost-analyst', ... }),
  context.df.callActivity('InvokeClaudeAgent', { agent: 'risk-assessor', ... })
];

const [marketAnalysis, technicalFeasibility, costAnalysis, riskAssessment] =
  yield context.df.Task.all(researchTasks);
```

### Conditional Execution (Based on Viability)

```javascript
if (viabilityScore >= 85 && costAnalysis.monthlyCost < 500) {
  // Auto-trigger build
  yield context.df.callSubOrchestrator('BuildPipelineOrchestrator', {...});
} else if (viabilityScore >= 60 && viabilityScore < 85) {
  // Escalate to human
  yield context.df.callActivity('EscalateToHuman', {...});
} else {
  // Archive with learnings
  yield context.df.callActivity('ArchiveWithLearnings', {...});
}
```
