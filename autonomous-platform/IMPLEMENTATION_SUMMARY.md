## 📐 Architecture Overview

```
Notion Workspace (Ideas → Research → Builds)
    ↓ Webhooks
Azure Function (Webhook Receiver)
    ↓ Trigger Matrix Evaluation
Durable Orchestrators (Build Pipeline, Research Swarm, etc.)
    ↓ Sequential/Parallel Execution
Activity Functions (Agent Invocation, GitHub, Azure, Notion Updates)
    ↓ Pattern Learning
Cosmos DB (Pattern Library with success rates and sub-patterns)
```

### Core Workflow: Build Pipeline

**Trigger**: Idea Status = "Active" AND Viability IN ["High", "Medium"] AND Effort IN ["XS", "S"]

**Stages**:
1. **Architecture Generation** (5-15 min)
   - Query pattern database for similar builds
   - Invoke @build-architect agent with pattern guidance
   - Validate cost threshold (<$500)

2. **Code Generation & GitHub** (10-30 min)
   - Generate complete codebase (backend, frontend, tests, CI/CD)
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Push initial commit

3. **Azure Deployment** (15-45 min)
   - Generate Bicep infrastructure templates
   - Deploy to Azure (App Service, databases, etc.)
   - Configure app settings from Key Vault

4. **Health Validation** (5-10 min)
   - Run health checks on deployed application
   - Execute automated tests
   - Attempt auto-remediation if failing

5. **Knowledge Capture** (10-20 min)
   - Extract learnings for Knowledge Vault
   - Update pattern library with new/updated patterns
   - Mark build as completed

**Total Duration**: 45 minutes - 2 hours (mostly autonomous)
