# Agent Activity Logging Template

**Purpose**: Standardized section to be added to all agent specification files for consistent activity logging guidance.

**Location in agent files**: Add this section near the end of each agent specification, before "Related Resources" or as the final operational section.

## Activity Logging

### Automatic Logging ‚úÖ

This agent's work is **automatically captured** by the Activity Logging Hook when invoked via the Task tool. The system logs session start, duration, files modified, deliverables, and related Notion items without any manual intervention.

**No action required** for standard work completion - the hook handles tracking automatically.

### Manual Logging Required üîî

**MUST use `/agent:log-activity` for these special events**:

1. **Work Handoffs** üîÑ - When transferring work to another agent or team member
2. **Blockers** üöß - When progress is blocked and requires external help
3. **Critical Milestones** üéØ - When reaching significant progress requiring stakeholder visibility
4. **Key Decisions** ‚úÖ - When session completion involves important architectural/cost/strategic choices
5. **Early Termination** ‚èπÔ∏è - When stopping work before completion due to scope change or discovered issues

### Command Format

```bash
/agent:log-activity @{AGENT-NAME} {status} "{detailed-description}"

# Status values: completed | blocked | handed-off | in-progress

# Example for this agent:
/agent:log-activity @{AGENT-NAME} completed "{Agent-specific work description with context, decisions, and next steps}"
```

### Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO**:
- Provide specific, actionable details (not generic "work complete")
- Include file paths, URLs, or Notion page IDs for context
- Document decisions with rationale (especially cost/architecture choices)
- Mention handoff recipient explicitly (@agent-name or team member)
- Explain blockers with specific resolution requirements

**‚ùå DON'T**:
- Log routine completions (automatic hook handles this)
- Use vague descriptions without actionable information
- Skip logging handoffs (causes workflow continuity breaks)
- Forget to update status when blockers are resolved

## Template Usage Instructions

### How to Apply to Agent Files

1. **Read the agent specification file** to understand its current structure
2. **Locate insertion point**:
   - Best position: After "Best Practices" or "Examples" section, before "Related Resources"
   - Alternative: As final operational section before file end
3. **Copy template content** from "Template Content (Copy from here)" section above
4. **Replace placeholders**:
   - `{AGENT-NAME}` ‚Üí Replace with actual agent name (e.g., `@cost-analyst`)
   - `{Agent-specific work description...}` ‚Üí Replace with agent-specific example relevant to agent's domain
5. **Adjust formatting** if needed to match agent file's existing style
6. **Verify links** work correctly (relative paths to docs)

### Example Application

**Before** (agent file without logging section):
```markdown

- [Cost Management](../docs/cost-management.md)
- [Software Tracker](../docs/notion-schema.md#software-tracker)

## Batch Update Script

To apply this template to all 38 agent files programmatically:

```powershell
# Script: .claude/utils/update-agent-logging.ps1
# Purpose: Batch-add Activity Logging section to all agent files

param(
    [switch]$DryRun = $false
)

$agentFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path ".claude/agents/*.md" -File
$templateContent = Get-Content -Path ".claude/templates/agent-logging-template.md" -Raw

# Extract template section (between "Template Content (Copy from here)" markers)
$templateSection = ($templateContent -split "## Template Content \(Copy from here\)")[1]
$templateSection = ($templateSection -split "---`n`n## Template Usage Instructions")[0]

foreach ($agentFile in $agentFiles) {
    $agentName = $agentFile.BaseName
    $content = Get-Content -Path $agentFile.FullName -Raw

    # Check if agent already has Activity Logging section
    if ($content -match "## Activity Logging") {
        Write-Host "‚úì $agentName - Already has Activity Logging section (skipping)" -ForegroundColor Green
        continue
    }

    # Replace placeholder {AGENT-NAME} with actual agent name
    $customizedTemplate = $templateSection -replace '\{AGENT-NAME\}', "@$agentName"

    # Find insertion point (before "Related Resources" or at end)
    if ($content -match "## Related Resources") {
        $updatedContent = $content -replace "(## Related Resources)", "$customizedTemplate`n`$1"
    } else {
        # Add at end before final separator
        $updatedContent = $content.TrimEnd() + "`n`n$customizedTemplate"
    }

    if ($DryRun) {
        Write-Host "Would update: $agentName" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    } else {
        Set-Content -Path $agentFile.FullName -Value $updatedContent -NoNewline
        Write-Host "‚úì Updated: $agentName" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}

Write-Host "`nBatch update complete!" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

**Usage**:
```powershell
# Dry run (preview changes without modifying files)
.\.claude\utils\update-agent-logging.ps1 -DryRun

# Execute (actually update all agent files)
.\.claude\utils\update-agent-logging.ps1
```
