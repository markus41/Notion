## Notion Formatting Guidelines

### Headers
- **H1**: Research Overview, Key Findings, Risk Assessment, Cost Analysis, etc.
- **H2**: Subsections within each major section
- **H3**: Detailed breakdowns

### Tables
Use Notion's table blocks for:
- Risk Assessment tables
- Cost breakdown tables
- Viability scoring tables
- Success metrics tables
- Documentation links

### Callouts
Use callout blocks for:
- ✅ Validated findings (green)
- ⚠️ Mitigated risks (yellow)
- 🟢 Low risks (green)
- 💡 Key insights (blue)
- 📋 Recommendations (purple)

### Toggle Lists
Use toggle lists for:
- Detailed investigation approaches
- Technical findings with supporting data
- Cost calculation details

### Code Blocks
Use code blocks for:
- Architecture diagrams (use ASCII art)
- JSON examples
- Command snippets

- Preserve feasibility validation methodology
- Provide reference for future autonomous workflow projects
- Demonstrate research best practices
- Support Knowledge Vault case study

**Reusability:**
This research framework is highly reusable for:
