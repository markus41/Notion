## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Inputs
1. Open "Inputs" sheet
2. Review and adjust development cost estimates (rows 3-9)
3. Update operational cost assumptions (rows 14-19)
4. Modify benefit assumptions and realization rates (rows 22-29)
5. Set discount rate and analysis parameters (rows 32-40)

### Step 2: Review Calculations
1. Navigate to "Benefits" sheet to see detailed benefit calculations
2. Review "Costs" sheet for monthly cost breakdown
3. Check "ROI Analysis" for break-even and NPV calculations

### Step 3: Analyze Sensitivity
1. Open "Sensitivity Analysis" sheet
2. Review tornado chart to identify most impactful variables
3. Examine scenario analysis (Best/Expected/Worst cases)
4. Use two-variable data table for custom sensitivity testing

### Step 4: Generate Reports
1. View "Executive Summary" for one-page dashboard
2. Copy charts from "Charts & Visuals" sheet for presentations
3. Print or export relevant sheets for stakeholder review

### Step 5: Update with Actuals
1. As project progresses, update "Inputs" with actual costs
2. Compare actual vs. projected in "ROI Analysis" sheet
3. Adjust assumptions based on real-world performance

## Validation & Quality Checks

**Formula Audits**:
- All formulas reference "Inputs" sheet for flexibility
- No hardcoded values in calculation sheets
- Circular reference check: None allowed
- Error handling: IFERROR() for division by zero

**Data Integrity**:
- Protected calculation sheets (unlock only input cells)
- Data validation lists for key assumptions
- Conditional formatting for out-of-range values
- Version control: Document changes in "Change Log" tab

**Accuracy Verification**:
- Cross-check totals across sheets
- Verify NPV calculation against financial model
- Validate IRR with external calculator
- Test sensitivity analysis with known inputs

## Excel File Implementation Notes

**To create this Excel file**:

1. Create new workbook with 7 sheets as specified above
2. Set up formulas as documented in each sheet section
3. Apply conditional formatting:
   - NPV cells: 3-color scale (Red-Yellow-Green)
   - ROI % cells: Data bars (green)
   - Variance cells: Icon sets (arrows)
4. Create charts as specified in "Charts & Visuals" sheet
5. Protect calculation sheets, leave input cells unlocked
6. Add data validation lists to input parameters
7. Format as currency ($) and percentages (%) appropriately
8. Test all scenarios and sensitivity calculations
9. Save as `.xlsx` format with macros disabled
