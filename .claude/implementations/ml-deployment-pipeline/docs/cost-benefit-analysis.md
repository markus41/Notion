```python
# Current State
current_success_rate = 60%
current_failures_per_month = 20 √ó (1 - 0.60) = 8 failures
current_failure_cost = 8 √ó $15,000 = $120,000/month

# Future State
future_success_rate = 85%
future_failures_per_month = 20 √ó (1 - 0.85) = 3 failures
future_failure_cost = 3 √ó $15,000 = $45,000/month

# Net Savings (Conservative: 20% realization)
monthly_savings = ($120,000 - $45,000) √ó 0.20 = $15,000
annual_savings = $15,000 √ó 12 = $180,000

# Note: This overlaps with Labor Cost Reduction
# Using lower estimate of $45,000/year to avoid double-counting
