**Top 5 Critical Risks** (Requiring Immediate Mitigation):
1. **R2**: Competitive Market Acquisition (HIGH likelihood, CRITICAL impact) - Wild Apricot acquires MemberClicks
2. **R5**: Multi-Tenant Data Breach (LOW likelihood, CRITICAL impact) - Security incident exposes customer data
3. **R8**: Build vs. Buy Analysis Favors Buying (MEDIUM likelihood, CRITICAL impact) - Research reveals white-label better
4. **R1**: Team Capacity Overload (HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact) - Team burnout or delays
5. **R4**: Customer Demand Validation Fails (HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact) - <6/10 interviews show interest

### Risk Management Strategy

**Philosophy**: **Proactive, research-driven risk mitigation** - Identify risks early, validate assumptions through research phase, and implement mitigations BEFORE significant investment.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Research Phase First** - Validate top 5 risks before MVP development
2. **Incremental Investment** - Start small ($30-50K MVP), scale based on success
3. **Transparent Communication** - Document all risks, share with stakeholders
4. **Continuous Monitoring** - Review risk register monthly, update mitigation status

**Overall Risk Level**: **MEDIUM-HIGH** (manageable with proactive mitigation)

## Critical Risks (9+ Impact Score)

### R2: Competitive Market Acquisition ⚠️

**Category**: Strategic
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3) - Consolidation is active in AMS market
**Impact**: CRITICAL (4) - Could eliminate competitive differentiation
**Risk Score**: **12** (CRITICAL)

**Description**:
Wild Apricot (market leader) or another major player acquires MemberClicks, Fonteva, or other competitors, creating a dominant consolidator with massive market share, brand recognition, and resources. This could:
- Eliminate mid-market competition (fewer alternatives for customers)
- Increase switching costs (integrated ecosystems harder to leave)
- Accelerate feature parity (acquirer copies our unique features)
- Trigger pricing pressure (economies of scale enable aggressive discounting)

**Early Warning Indicators**:
- Industry news of acquisition discussions
- Sudden competitor product improvements
- Pricing wars or aggressive discounting
- Customer consolidation (associations switching to consolidated platforms)

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Pre-Launch (Months 1-12)**:
1. **Establish strong differentiation** - Focus on features competitors cannot easily copy:
   - Hierarchical content distribution (complex, not trivial)
   - AI command palette (requires LLM expertise and data)
   - Microsoft-first integration (deep Graph API expertise)
2. **Build customer loyalty early** - 50 beta customers with strong relationships
3. **Document competitive moats** - Technical architecture, proprietary algorithms
4. **Secure customer contracts** - 1-year minimum commitments, cancellation penalties
5. **Prepare acquisition defense** - If approached, have clear valuation and terms

**Post-Launch (Year 1+)**:
1. **Accelerate feature development** - Stay 12-18 months ahead of competitors
2. **Deepen integrations** - Make switching painful (Teams, SharePoint, Power BI)
3. **Build network effects** - National associations bring regional/local chapters (sticky)
4. **Prepare for partnerships** - If can't compete, partner or sell strategically

**Contingency Plan** (If consolidation happens):
- **Option A**: Accelerate Series A fundraising ($5-10M) to compete on resources
- **Option B**: Position for strategic acquisition (sell to Microsoft, Salesforce, etc.)
- **Option C**: Pivot to niche market (e.g., only 501c6 trade associations, not full AMS)

**Mitigation Cost**: Minimal (strategy, not resources)
**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM (cannot fully control external acquisitions)
**Owner**: Brad (competitive monitoring), Markus (technical moats)

### R5: Multi-Tenant Data Breach ⚠️

**Category**: Operational (Security)
**Likelihood**: LOW (1) - With proper security controls
**Impact**: CRITICAL (4) - Company-ending event
**Risk Score**: **4** (CRITICAL when realized)

**Description**:
Security incident exposes customer data across tenants:
- Organization A's members see Organization B's data
- Customer passwords, payment information, personal data leaked
- Regulatory penalties (GDPR fines up to 4% of revenue or €20M)
- Reputation destruction (no associations will trust platform)
- Legal liability (class action lawsuits)

**Attack Vectors**:
1. **SQL injection** - Bypasses organizationId filtering
2. **Broken access control** - API endpoint doesn't enforce RLS
3. **Authentication bypass** - JWT token forged or stolen
4. **Insider threat** - Malicious employee or contractor
5. **Supply chain attack** - Compromised npm package or Azure service

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Architecture-Level Security** (Phase 1, Weeks 1-4):
1. **Row-level security (RLS)** on Azure SQL Database
   ```sql
   CREATE SECURITY POLICY OrganizationIsolation
   ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate(OrganizationId)
   ON dbo.Members, dbo.Events, dbo.Donations, ...
   WITH (STATE = ON);
   ```
2. **Prisma middleware** - Automatic organizationId injection on all queries
   ```typescript
   prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
     if (params.model && organizationScopedModels.includes(params.model)) {
       if (!params.args.where) params.args.where = {};
       params.args.where.organizationId = currentOrgId;
     }
     return next(params);
   });
   ```
3. **Context-based access control** - Every API request includes authenticated user + organization
4. **Zero trust networking** - All services authenticate via Azure AD Managed Identity

**Code-Level Security** (Ongoing):
1. **Input validation** - Zod schemas on all user input (prevent SQL injection)
2. **Parameterized queries** - NEVER string concatenation in SQL (Prisma handles this)
3. **Output encoding** - Prevent XSS attacks
4. **Security linting** - ESLint rules for security (eslint-plugin-security)
5. **Dependency scanning** - npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot alerts

**Testing & Auditing** (Phase 6, Weeks 43-44):
1. **Penetration testing** - External security firm (annual)
2. **Automated security testing** - OWASP ZAP in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Code review** - All PRs reviewed for security issues
4. **Security audit** - Pre-launch audit by Azure Security Center
5. **Bug bounty program** - Reward external researchers for finding vulnerabilities (Year 2+)

**Monitoring & Response** (Production):
1. **Azure Sentinel SIEM** - Real-time threat detection
2. **Anomaly detection** - Unusual data access patterns alert on-call engineer
3. **Incident response plan** - Documented procedure for breach (isolate, notify, remediate)
4. **Breach insurance** - Cyber liability insurance ($1-2M coverage)

**Mitigation Cost**: $20-30K (penetration test, security audit, insurance)
**Residual Risk**: LOW (with all mitigations in place)
**Owner**: Alec (infrastructure), Markus (code review)

### R8: Build vs. Buy Analysis Favors Buying ⚠️

**Category**: Strategic
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (2) - Possible, depends on research findings
**Impact**: CRITICAL (4) - Entire project premise invalidated
**Risk Score**: **8** (CRITICAL)

**Description**:
Research phase build vs. buy analysis reveals that buying/partnering is economically superior to building:
- **Scenario 1**: White-label existing solution (e.g., Wild Apricot OEM) costs 50% less over 5 years
- **Scenario 2**: Partnership (integrate with existing platform) provides faster time-to-market
- **Scenario 3**: Customer interviews show no willingness to switch from incumbents

If buying is clearly better (>20% TCO advantage), then building MVP is poor investment decision.

**Build vs. Buy Comparison Framework**:

| Factor | Build | Buy/Partner | Weight |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **5-Year TCO** | $2-3M (MVP + 2 years operations) | $1-1.5M (licensing fees) | 30% |
| **Time to Market** | 12 months (MVP) | 3-6 months (white-label) | 20% |
| **Differentiation** | HIGH (unique features) | LOW (generic platform) | 25% |
| **Strategic Control** | HIGH (own IP, roadmap) | LOW (dependent on vendor) | 15% |
| **Scalability** | HIGH (built for scale) | MEDIUM (vendor limits) | 10% |

**Weighted Scoring**: Build must score ≥20% higher than Buy to justify investment.

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Research Phase (Weeks 3-4)**:
1. **Comprehensive TCO analysis** - Detailed cost modeling (see analysis template below)
2. **White-label vendor evaluation** - Request proposals from Wild Apricot, MemberClicks, others
3. **Partnership exploration** - Discuss integration opportunities with existing platforms
4. **Strategic value assessment** - Quantify value of differentiation, control, and IP ownership

**TCO Analysis Template**:

```
BUILD SCENARIO:
Year 0 (MVP): $30-50K (team time)
Year 1: $200K (operations, infrastructure, support)
Year 2: $300K (team expansion, enhancements)
Total 3-Year TCO: $530-550K

BUY/WHITE-LABEL SCENARIO:
Year 0 (Setup): $50K (licensing, customization, training)
Year 1: $150K (licensing fees, support)
Year 2: $180K (licensing fees, growth)
Total 3-Year TCO: $380K

DIFFERENCE: Build costs $150-170K MORE (39% higher TCO)

STRATEGIC PREMIUM JUSTIFICATION:
- Differentiation value: $100K+ (unique features drive higher ARPU)
- Strategic control value: $75K+ (own roadmap, no vendor lock-in)
- IP ownership value: $50K+ (can sell/license platform later)
TOTAL STRATEGIC VALUE: $225K

CONCLUSION: Build justifies premium due to strategic value ($225K > $170K cost difference)
```

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Proceed with BUILD IF**: Total strategic value > TCO difference (as shown above)
- **Pivot to BUY/PARTNER IF**: TCO difference >$250K and strategic value <$150K

**Contingency Plan** (If Buy wins):
- **Option A**: White-label existing platform, focus on unique feature add-ons
- **Option B**: Partner with existing platform (integrate hierarchical content as plugin)
- **Option C**: Archive project, refocus on Power BI consulting (core Brookside BI business)

**Mitigation Cost**: $5-10K (analyst time for comprehensive comparison)
**Residual Risk**: LOW (if analysis is thorough and objective)
**Owner**: Stephan (TCO analysis), Brad (vendor evaluation)

### R1: Team Capacity Overload ⚠️

**Category**: Execution
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3) - Team already busy with Innovation Nexus
**Impact**: HIGH (3) - Burnout, delays, quality issues
**Risk Score**: **9** (CRITICAL)

**Description**:
5-person team cannot sustain 60-80% allocation to AMS MVP for 12 months:
- **Burnout risk** - Working >50 hours/week consistently leads to exhaustion
- **Quality degradation** - Rushing to meet milestones causes technical debt
- **Delays** - Underestimated tasks push timeline from 12 → 18+ months
- **Opportunity cost** - Neglecting existing Innovation Nexus builds and consulting clients

**Current Capacity Assessment**:
```
Team: 5 members × 40 hours/week = 200 hours/week total
Target AMS Allocation: 60-80% = 120-160 hours/week
Remaining Capacity: 40-80 hours/week for other work

Current Innovation Nexus Commitments:
- 15 active builds (estimate: 60-80 hours/week ongoing)
- Power BI consulting clients (estimate: 40-60 hours/week)
TOTAL: 100-140 hours/week already committed

SHORTFALL: 20-60 hours/week (team is OVER-ALLOCATED)
```

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Pre-MVP (Research Phase)**:
1. **Archive lower-priority builds** (Target: Free up 30-40 hours/week)
   - Review 15 active Innovation Nexus builds
   - Identify 5-8 builds with Status = "Not Active" or low business value
   - Archive with learnings documented in Knowledge Vault
   - Redirect freed capacity to AMS MVP
2. **Team allocation commitment** (Formal agreements)
   - Each team member signs allocation commitment (60-80% to AMS)
   - Document expectations, scope, and timeline
   - Address concerns and negotiate realistic commitments
3. **Buffer time in estimates** (Add 20% contingency)
   - MVP plan shows 48 weeks nominal timeline
   - Reality: Expect 52-58 weeks with buffer
   - Communicate realistic timeline to stakeholders

**During MVP (Phases 1-6)**:
1. **Weekly capacity monitoring** (Scrum Master role)
   - Track actual hours vs. planned hours per person
   - Identify over-allocation early (>40 hours/week consistently)
   - Adjust sprint scope to match realistic capacity
2. **Contract specialists for gaps** (Hire external help)
   - UI/UX designer (Phases 3, 5): ~100 hours, $10-15K
   - QA automation engineer (Phases 3-6): ~200 hours, $20-30K
   - Security auditor (Phase 6): ~80 hours, $10-15K
   - TOTAL: ~$40-60K external resources
3. **Sustainable pace enforcement** (Team health metrics)
   - Max 45 hours/week per person (no crunch time)
   - Mandatory 1 week off per quarter (prevent burnout)
   - Regular team retrospectives (identify stressors early)

**Contingency Plan** (If capacity crisis occurs):
- **Option A**: Extend timeline - Add 3-6 months buffer, communicate to stakeholders
- **Option B**: Reduce MVP scope - Cut non-essential features (e.g., Power BI integration → Phase 2)
- **Option C**: Hire additional resources - Bring on 1-2 contractors ($100-150K/year)

**Mitigation Cost**: $40-60K (contract specialists)
**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM (capacity is constrained but manageable)
**Owner**: Markus (overall capacity), Stephan (sprint planning)

### R4: Customer Demand Validation Fails ⚠️

**Category**: Strategic (Market)
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3) - No customer interviews conducted yet
**Impact**: HIGH (3) - MVP built for non-existent demand
**Risk Score**: **9** (CRITICAL)

**Description**:
Research phase customer interviews reveal weak demand:
- **<6/10 interviews show interest** (target: ≥8/10)
- Pain points not severe enough to drive switching
- Associations happy with existing solutions (Wild Apricot, MemberClicks)
- Pricing sensitivity too high ($500-2,000/month perceived as expensive)
- Hierarchical content feature not valued (nice-to-have, not must-have)

**Demand Validation Failure Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Feature-Market Misalignment**
- Hierarchical content is interesting but not critical pain point
- Associations prioritize other features (e.g., mobile app, better reporting)
- AMS platform addresses wrong problems

**Scenario 2: Switching Costs Too High**
- Associations invested heavily in current systems (customization, integrations, training)
- Migration pain (data export/import) perceived as too risky
- Incumbent relationships strong (account managers, support history)

**Scenario 3: Pricing Misalignment**
- $500-2,000/month is above budget for many associations
- Competitors offer lower-priced tiers ($200-500/month)
- Value proposition doesn't justify premium pricing

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Research Phase (Weeks 1-2)**:
1. **Structured customer interviews** (10 associations, 60 min each)
   - Target: Executive Directors, Membership Directors of 501(c)(6) trade associations
   - Current software: Wild Apricot (4), MemberClicks (3), Fonteva (2), Custom (1)
   - Association size: 500-5,000 members (target market sweet spot)
   - Annual revenue: $500K-5M (can afford $500-2,000/month)

**Interview Protocol** (see RESEARCH-PLAN.md for full script):
- **Pain point discovery**: "What are your top 3 frustrations with current AMS?"
- **Hierarchical content validation**: "Do you manage multiple chapters? How do you distribute content?"
- **Switching willingness**: "What would make you consider switching AMS providers?"
- **Pricing sensitivity**: "What do you currently pay? What would you pay for ideal solution?"
- **Feature prioritization**: Rank 15 features by importance (see which resonate)

2. **Validation Criteria** (Go/No-Go Thresholds):
   - **PROCEED IF**: ≥8/10 interviews show "definitely would switch" OR "probably would switch"
   - **CAUTION IF**: 6-7/10 show interest (investigate further, adjust positioning)
   - **STOP IF**: <6/10 show interest (demand insufficient)

3. **Pivot Options** (If demand weak):
   - **Option A**: Adjust feature set (prioritize what customers actually want)
   - **Option B**: Target different segment (e.g., government associations, labor unions)
   - **Option C**: Niche down (build ONLY for national associations with chapters)
   - **Option D**: Archive project (no viable market)

**Post-Interview Actions**:
- Synthesize findings into demand validation report
- Update viability score based on customer feedback
- Adjust MVP feature roadmap to match validated demand
- Communicate findings to stakeholders with recommendation

**Contingency Plan** (If validation fails):
- Conduct 5 additional interviews with different segment (501c3, 501c4, 501c5)
- Adjust pricing model (lower entry tier, freemium approach)
- Pivot to partnership (integrate with existing platforms vs. compete head-on)
- Archive project if no viable path forward

**Mitigation Cost**: $5-10K (interview incentives, analysis time)
**Residual Risk**: LOW (with thorough customer discovery)
**Owner**: Brad (customer interviews), Stephan (demand analysis)

## High Priority Risks (6-8 Impact Score)

### R3: Microsoft Integration Complexity

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (2)
**Impact**: HIGH (3)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
Microsoft Graph API integrations prove more complex than expected:
- Authentication issues (Azure AD B2C multi-tenant configuration)
- Permission scoping errors (overly broad or insufficient permissions)
- Rate limiting (throttling on Graph API calls)
- API instability (breaking changes, deprecated endpoints)
- Integration with Teams, SharePoint, Outlook takes 2-3X longer than estimated

**Mitigation**:
- **Early POC** (Research Phase): Test Microsoft Graph authentication and basic CRUD operations
- **Microsoft partner support**: Engage Microsoft FastTrack or partner success team
- **Incremental integration**: Start with simple integrations (user profile sync) before complex (Teams bot)
- **Fallback plan**: Use standard APIs (SMTP, REST) if Graph API issues persist

**Owner**: Alec (integrations), Markus (architecture)

---

### R6: AI Command Palette Accuracy

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (2)
**Impact**: HIGH (3)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
AI command palette doesn't achieve target accuracy (>85% intent recognition):
- Natural language parsing errors (ambiguous queries)
- Function calling mismatches (wrong action executed)
- Context awareness insufficient (doesn't understand user's current page)
- User frustration with incorrect results (adoption drops below 50%)

**Mitigation**:
- **Extensive prompt engineering** (Phase 5, Weeks 33-34): Test 100+ sample queries, refine prompts iteratively
- **Start small**: Launch with 10 core commands, expand gradually based on accuracy
- **Disambiguation prompts**: When intent unclear, ask clarifying questions
- **Fallback to manual**: Always provide manual command selection option
- **Continuous improvement**: Track accuracy metrics, retrain model based on actual usage

**Owner**: Markus (AI development), Stephan (UX testing)

---

### R7: Skill Gaps Slow Development

**Category**: Execution
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (2)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
Team learning curve for new technologies delays development:
- Next.js 14 App Router (new paradigm vs. Pages Router)
- Prisma ORM (different from traditional ORMs)
- GraphQL with Apollo Server (not as familiar as REST)
- Azure AI Search (new service, learning curve)
- Estimated 3-week learning sprint extends to 6-8 weeks

**Mitigation**:
- **3-week learning sprint BEFORE MVP** (Pre-Phase 1):
  - Week 1: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript 5.0 (online courses, tutorials)
  - Week 2: Prisma ORM, GraphQL with Apollo (build sample CRUD app)
  - Week 3: Azure AI Search, Azure Cache for Redis (integrate into sample app)
- **Pair programming**: Experienced developers pair with those learning
- **Contract specialists**: Hire Next.js expert for 2-4 weeks to accelerate team (mentor role)
- **Microsoft Learn**: Azure certifications for team members (Azure AI Engineer, Azure Developer)

**Owner**: Markus (technical training), All team members

---

### R12: Technical Debt Accumulation

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (2)
**Impact**: HIGH (3)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
Rushing to MVP creates technical debt that slows future development:
- Code quality suffers (skipped tests, copy-paste code, poor abstractions)
- Architecture shortcuts taken (hardcoded values, tight coupling)
- Documentation skipped (no comments, no architecture diagrams)
- Refactoring backlog grows (10-20% of sprint capacity consumed by tech debt)

**Mitigation**:
- **Code review process**: All PRs reviewed before merge (enforce quality standards)
- **Automated testing**: >80% code coverage target (unit, integration, E2E tests)
- **Refactoring budget**: Allocate 10% of each sprint to paying down tech debt
- **Documentation as code**: Write docs concurrently with development (not after)
- **Technical spike sprints**: Every 6 sprints, dedicate 1 sprint to refactoring and cleanup

**Owner**: Markus (code review), All developers

---

### R14: Customer Onboarding Friction

**Category**: Operational
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (2)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
Beta customers struggle to onboard successfully:
- Data import/migration failures (CSV import errors, data quality issues)
- Complexity of initial setup (too many configuration options, unclear workflow)
- Lack of training materials (no videos, documentation insufficient)
- Support response slow (email-only support, 24-hour response time)
- **>20% onboarding failure rate** (customers give up before going live)

**Mitigation**:
- **Onboarding wizard** (Phase 3, Weeks 19-20): Step-by-step guided setup
- **Data import validation** (Phase 1, Weeks 5-6): Comprehensive error reporting and correction
- **Video tutorials** (Phase 6, Weeks 45-46): Screen recordings for common tasks
- **Live onboarding sessions** (Beta Phase): 1-hour onboarding call for each new customer
- **Knowledge base**: Self-service documentation (FAQs, how-tos, troubleshooting)
- **Success metrics**: Track time-to-first-value (<7 days from signup to first event created)

**Owner**: Stephan (onboarding UX), Brad (customer success)

---

### R15: Performance Issues at Scale

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (2)
**Impact**: HIGH (3)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
System performance degrades with scale:
- Database queries slow down (>1 second for member list with 10,000+ members)
- Search response time increases (>500ms for complex queries)
- Concurrent user load causes issues (>500 users online → slowdowns)
- Azure resources hit limits (App Service CPU/memory, SQL DTU saturation)

**Mitigation**:
- **Performance benchmarking** (Phase 6, Weeks 47-48): Load test with 1,000 concurrent users
- **Database optimization**:
  - Proper indexing (organizationId, email, status, createdAt)
  - Query optimization (no N+1 queries, use joins instead of sequential fetches)
  - Connection pooling (Prisma connection pool configured)
- **Caching strategy**:
  - Azure Cache for Redis (member profiles, organization settings, search results)
  - Cache invalidation rules (TTL: 5 min for dynamic data, 24 hours for static data)
- **CDN**: Azure Front Door for static assets (images, CSS, JS)
- **Horizontal scaling**: Azure App Service auto-scaling (2-10 instances based on CPU)

**Owner**: Markus (backend performance), Alec (infrastructure scaling)

### R17: Penetration Test Failures

**Category**: Operational (Security)
**Likelihood**: LOW (1)
**Impact**: HIGH (3)
**Risk Score**: **3** (but moves to HIGH if realized)

**Description**:
External penetration test reveals critical vulnerabilities:
- SQL injection found in API endpoints
- Authentication bypass possible
- Cross-tenant data access via crafted requests
- **Result**: Cannot launch until vulnerabilities fixed (3-6 week delay)

**Mitigation**:
- **Security testing during development** (Phases 1-5):
  - OWASP ZAP automated scanning in CI/CD pipeline
  - ESLint security rules (eslint-plugin-security)
  - Snyk dependency scanning (vulnerabilities in npm packages)
- **Pre-penetration test preparation** (Phase 6, Week 42):
  - Internal security audit (Azure Security Center recommendations)
  - Fix known issues before external test
- **Budget buffer**: Assume 2-4 weeks for remediation in timeline

**Owner**: Alec (security), Markus (code security)

---

### R18: Open-Source Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Category**: Technical
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (2)
**Risk Score**: **6** (HIGH)

**Description**:
Critical vulnerability discovered in npm dependency:
- React, Next.js, Prisma, or other core library has security flaw
- Exploit is actively being used in the wild
- Patch requires significant code changes (breaking API changes)
- Must apply patch immediately (cannot wait for planned maintenance window)

**Mitigation**:
- **Automated dependency scanning**:
  - Dependabot (GitHub automatic PRs for security updates)
  - Snyk integration (CI/CD pipeline fails if critical vulnerabilities found)
  - npm audit (run weekly, review results)
- **Stay current with updates**: Upgrade dependencies quarterly (minor versions monthly, major versions quarterly)
- **Lock file management**: Use package-lock.json to ensure reproducible builds
- **Vulnerability response plan**: Documented procedure for emergency patching (deploy hot-fix within 48 hours)

### R13: GDPR Compliance Gaps

**Category**: Regulatory & Compliance
**Likelihood**: LOW (1)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (2)
**Risk Score**: **2** (MEDIUM)

**Description**:
GDPR compliance implementation incomplete or incorrect:
- Consent tracking insufficient (no clear opt-in records)
- Data retention policies unclear (how long to keep deleted member data?)
- Right to erasure not fully implemented (orphaned data in backups)
- Data processing agreements (DPAs) missing with sub-processors
- Fines up to 4% of revenue or €20M (unlikely for startup but reputational damage)

**Mitigation**:
- **GDPR compliance checklist** (Phase 1-2):
  - Consent management system (clear opt-in for emails, data processing)
  - Data retention policy (30 days post-account deletion)
  - Right to erasure implementation (anonymize data, preserve aggregate analytics)
  - DPAs with Stripe, SendGrid, Microsoft (sub-processors)
- **Privacy policy and terms**: Clear, legally reviewed documents

### R16: SOC 2 Audit Readiness

**Category**: Regulatory & Compliance
**Likelihood**: LOW (1)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (2)
**Risk Score**: **2** (MEDIUM)

**Description**:
SOC 2 Type II audit preparation reveals gaps in security controls:
- Access control procedures undocumented
- Incident response plan incomplete
- Vendor management process missing
- Employee background checks not performed
- **Result**: Cannot achieve SOC 2 certification, enterprise customers won't buy

**Mitigation**:
- **SOC 2 preparation roadmap** (Months 6-12):
  - Document all security policies and procedures
  - Implement access control (principle of least privilege)
  - Create incident response plan (documented, tested)
  - Vendor risk assessment process (evaluate all sub-processors)
- **External audit** (Month 10-12): Hire SOC 2 auditor ($10-20K)

**Description**:
Competitors copy AMS platform's unique features:
- Wild Apricot adds hierarchical content distribution (12-18 months after AMS launch)
- MemberClicks launches AI command palette (18-24 months later)
- Differentiation erodes over time (unique features become table stakes)

**Mitigation**:
- **Continuous innovation**: Stay 12-18 months ahead (roadmap of next unique features)
- **Deep integrations**: Make switching painful (Teams, SharePoint, Power BI deeply integrated)
- **Customer relationships**: Strong relationships and customer success reduce churn
- **Network effects**: National associations bring regional/local chapters (multi-tenant stickiness)
- **Accept reality**: Features WILL be copied eventually, plan for it

**Owner**: Brad (competitive intelligence), Markus (feature roadmap)

### R20: Customer Churn

**Category**: Financial (Revenue)
**Likelihood**: HIGH (3)
**Impact**: LOW (1) - In MVP phase
**Risk Score**: **3** (MEDIUM)

**Description**:
Beta customers churn before MVP launch or within first 6 months:
- Product doesn't meet expectations (features missing or buggy)
- Support issues unresolved (slow response, unhelpful answers)
- Pricing too high vs. value delivered
- **Result**: <30 customers retained (target: 50), ARR <$200K (target: $300-500K)

**Mitigation**:
- **Customer success program** (Beta Phase):
  - Weekly check-in calls (first 4 weeks)
  - Monthly check-ins (ongoing)
  - Proactive issue resolution (don't wait for customers to complain)
  - Feature request tracking (show customers their requests are heard)
- **Usage analytics**: Monitor engagement metrics (login frequency, feature usage)
- **Churn risk scoring**: Identify at-risk customers early (low usage, support tickets)
- **Win-back campaigns**: Re-engage churned customers (special offers, new features)
- **Target churn rate**: <5% monthly (industry benchmark for SaaS)

**Owner**: Brad (customer success), Stephan (analytics)

### R22: Third-Party Service Dependencies

**Category**: External
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (2)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (2)
**Risk Score**: **4** (MEDIUM)

**Description**:
Critical dependency on third-party services:
- **Stripe** (payment processing): Outage means no payments accepted
- **SendGrid** (email delivery): Outage means no emails sent
- **Azure OpenAI** (AI command palette): Outage means AI features broken
- Vendor pricing increases (Stripe fees increase, SendGrid tier upgraded)
- Vendor discontinues service or changes terms

**Mitigation**:
- **Vendor diversification** (where feasible):
  - Email: SendGrid primary, Microsoft Graph fallback (for organizational emails)
  - Payments: Stripe primary, consider Braintree as backup (future)
- **Vendor relationship management**: Maintain good relationship, stay informed of changes
- **Contract negotiation**: Lock in pricing for 1-2 years where possible
- **Abstraction layer**: Don't tightly couple to vendor APIs (make switching easier)

**Owner**: Brad (vendor management), Markus (abstraction layer)

### R24: Microsoft Partnership Ends

**Category**: External
**Likelihood**: LOW (1)
**Impact**: LOW (1)
**Risk Score**: **1** (LOW)

**Description**:
Theoretical scenario where Microsoft ecosystem access restricted:
- Azure pricing increases significantly (>50% cost increase)
- Microsoft Graph API deprecated or restricted
- Teams app store policy changes (AMS app rejected)
- **Result**: Strategic moat erodes, migration to alternative stack needed

**Mitigation**:
- **Maintain abstractions**: Don't tightly couple to Microsoft APIs (use adapter pattern)
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensure core features work without Microsoft dependencies
- **Monitor Microsoft announcements**: Stay informed of strategic changes

**Owner**: Alec (Microsoft relationship)
