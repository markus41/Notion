## Executive Summary

### Timeline & Investment

**Total Duration**: 9-12 months (48 weeks nominal, 52 weeks with buffer)
**Investment**: $30-50K (5-person team, existing Brookside BI resources)
**Target Outcome**: 50 beta customers, $300-500K ARR, production-ready MVP

### Development Philosophy

**Research-First Approach**:
- Mandatory 3-4 week research phase BEFORE any development (see RESEARCH-PLAN.md)
- Viability score must be ≥75 to proceed
- Go/no-go decision gate at Week 4

**Status-Driven Milestones** (not deadline-driven):
- Each phase has clear completion criteria
- Quality gates between phases
- Flexible sprint boundaries based on actual progress

**Microsoft-First Architecture**:
- 75% Microsoft ecosystem alignment
- Azure AI Search (replaces Elasticsearch + Pinecone)
- Azure Cache for Redis (managed service)
- Azure SQL Database (consider vs PostgreSQL)
- Azure Functions, Key Vault, App Services

### Unique Differentiators (Competitive Moats)

1. **Hierarchical Content Distribution** ← NO COMPETITOR HAS THIS
2. **AI-Powered Command Palette** ← NO COMPETITOR HAS THIS
3. **Advanced Donation Management** ← DIFFERENTIATED
4. **Microsoft-First Integration** ← UNIQUE POSITIONING

## Risk Mitigation

### Top Risks Specific to MVP Development

**Risk 1: Team Capacity Overload** (HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Maintain 60-80% allocation target
  - Archive lower-priority Innovation Nexus builds
  - Hire contract specialists for specialized work
  - Buffer time in estimates (add 20% contingency)

**Risk 2: Skill Gaps Slow Development** (HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM impact)
- **Mitigation**:
  - 3-week learning sprint before Phase 1 (Next.js, Prisma, GraphQL, Azure)
  - Pair programming for knowledge transfer
  - Contract specialists for gaps (UI/UX, security)
  - Microsoft Learn and Azure certifications

**Risk 3: Microsoft Integration Complexity** (MEDIUM likelihood, HIGH impact)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start Teams/SharePoint integration early (Phase 4)
  - Microsoft partner support engagement
  - Proof-of-concept integrations during research phase
  - Fallback to standard APIs if Graph API issues arise

**Risk 4: AI Command Palette Accuracy** (MEDIUM likelihood, MEDIUM impact)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Extensive prompt engineering and testing
  - Start with 10 core commands, expand gradually
  - Clear disambiguation prompts when intent unclear
  - Fallback to manual command selection

**Risk 5: Multi-Tenant Data Breach** (LOW likelihood, CRITICAL impact)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Azure SQL row-level security from Day 1
  - Penetration testing before beta launch
  - Security audit by external firm
  - Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
