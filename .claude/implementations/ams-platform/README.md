## Risk Management

### Top 5 Risks

1. **Team Capacity Overload** (HIGH likelihood, HIGH impact)
   - Mitigation: Dedicate 60-80% allocation, archive lower-priority builds

2. **Competitive Market Acquisition** (HIGH likelihood, CRITICAL impact)
   - Mitigation: Clear differentiation, pilot with friendly associations, case studies

3. **Build vs. Buy Reveals Buying Better** (MEDIUM likelihood, CRITICAL impact)
   - Mitigation: Thorough research phase BEFORE development

4. **Skill Gaps Slow Development** (HIGH likelihood, MEDIUM impact)
   - Mitigation: 3-week learning sprint, pair programming, contract specialists

5. **Multi-Tenant Data Breach** (MEDIUM likelihood, CRITICAL impact)
   - Mitigation: Azure SQL row-level security, penetration testing, security audit

**Full Risk Register**: See RISK-REGISTER.md for comprehensive matrix
