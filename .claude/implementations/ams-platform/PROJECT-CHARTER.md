# AMS Platform - Project Charter

**Brookside BI Innovation Nexus** - Establish comprehensive association management infrastructure to streamline operations and drive measurable outcomes for nonprofit organizations

---

## Executive Summary

**Project Name**: The Total Association Operating System (AMS Platform)

**Vision**: Build a complete association management platform that evolves from core MVP (Year 1) into a comprehensive "walled garden" ecosystem (Years 2-10) replacing 40+ third-party tools and generating revenue from every transaction, service, and data point in the association economy.

**Business Case**: Associations currently pay $50,000-150,000 annually across dozens of fragmented vendors (Zoom, Slack, Wild Apricot, Cvent, QuickBooks, etc.). Our unified platform consolidates these services while providing superior integration, reducing costs by 60-80%, and creating switching costs that drive long-term retention.

**Strategic Approach**: **Phased execution starting with MVP**, not attempting full vision immediately. Prove product-market fit with core capabilities before expanding into adjacent services.

**Best for**: Organizations seeking to capture a massive market opportunity ($2B+ TAM) through disciplined, research-driven execution starting with a focused MVP and expanding based on validated customer demand.

## Business Case & Problem Statement

### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: $2-3B annually

| Segment | Count | Avg Annual Spend | Market Size |
|---------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| 501(c)(6) Trade Associations | 66,000 | $30,000 | $1.98B |
| 501(c)(3) Charitable Organizations | 1,500,000 | $5,000 | $7.5B (addressable: $500M) |
| 501(c)(4) Advocacy Groups | 80,000 | $20,000 | $1.6B |
| 501(c)(5) Labor Unions | 10,000 | $50,000 | $500M |
| 501(c)(7) Social Clubs | 300,000 | $10,000 | $3B (addressable: $200M) |
| Government Associations | 5,000 | $75,000 | $375M |

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: $1B annually (associations with >250 members, annual revenue >$500K)

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) - Year 5**: $100M (10% market share in target segments)

### Problem Statement

Associations face three critical challenges:

1. **Fragmented Technology Stack**
   - Average association uses 15-30 different software tools
   - $50K-150K annual spend across multiple vendors
   - Integration complexity requires dedicated IT staff or consultants
   - Data silos prevent holistic member view
   - Cognitive load managing dozens of logins, contracts, support relationships

2. **Vendor Lock-In Without Value**
   - Legacy AMS platforms (Wild Apricot, MemberClicks) charge high prices ($10K-50K/year)
   - Limited innovation due to installed base inertia
   - Poor user experience drives low member engagement
   - Expensive custom development for specialized needs
   - Switching costs high due to data migration complexity

3. **Untapped Revenue Opportunities**
   - Members underserved with basic functionality
   - Non-dues revenue difficult to generate (limited marketplace, benefits, services)
   - Financial services fragmented (banking, insurance, payments separate)
   - Data insights limited by siloed systems
   - Group purchasing power not leveraged

### Our Solution

**Phase 1 MVP**: Establish unified association management platform with three unique differentiators that competitors lack:

1. **Hierarchical Content Distribution**
   - National organizations push content to regional/local chapters with inheritance rules
   - Chapter customization with national override capabilities
   - Automatic content routing based on member location and interests
   - **Competitive Advantage**: No existing AMS handles complex organizational hierarchies effectively

2. **AI-Powered Command Palette**
   - Natural language interface (Cmd+K) for all platform actions
   - "Schedule committee meeting next Tuesday at 2pm" → Automated execution
   - "Show me members at risk of churning" → Instant AI analysis
   - **Competitive Advantage**: First AMS with conversational AI interface

3. **Advanced Donation Management**
   - Corporate matching automation (employer contributions)
   - Tribute giving (in honor/memory workflows)
   - Recurring giving with smart nudges
   - **Competitive Advantage**: Nonprofit-grade fundraising in AMS context

**Phase 2-3 Expansion**: Systematically replace every tool in association tech stack, creating economic moat through:
- **Data Advantage**: Every interaction generates intelligence for recommendations and predictions
- **Switching Costs**: Value proposition grows with each added module
- **Network Effects**: Group purchasing, benchmarking, job boards improve with scale
- **Simplicity**: One vendor, one invoice, one login, one support team

| Redis | **Azure Cache for Redis** | Managed service, enterprise SLA, seamless Azure integration |
| PostgreSQL | Consider **Azure SQL Database** | Tighter Microsoft integration (Prisma supports both, minimal code change) |
| ✅ Next.js | ✅ Keep | Industry standard, no Microsoft equivalent, acceptable |
| ✅ Prisma ORM | ✅ Keep | Modern ORM, no Microsoft equivalent, acceptable |
| ✅ GraphQL/Apollo | ✅ Keep | API flexibility, no Microsoft equivalent, acceptable |
