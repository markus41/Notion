---

## Executive Summary

### Revenue Philosophy

**We don't just monetize software. We monetize every financial flow, every data point, every transaction, every service need in the entire association economy.**

**Core Principle**: Build infrastructure, capture value at every transaction point.

### Revenue Evolution Overview

| Tier | Timeline | ARR Target | Revenue Streams | Margin Profile |
|------|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Year 1 | $300-500K | 3 streams (SaaS, transactions, services) | 60-70% gross margin |
| **Tier 2** | Years 2-5 | $40-60M | 7+ streams (adds financial services, insurance, data) | 70-80% gross margin |
| **Tier 3** | Years 5-10 | $500M-1B | 10+ streams (complete ecosystem monetization) | 75-85% gross margin |

**Key Insight**: As platform matures, SaaS subscriptions become smaller % of revenue (60% → 40% → 25%), but total margins IMPROVE due to high-margin financial services and data monetization.

- Positioning: "Association-friendly rates, better than Stripe but fair margin for us"

Event Registration Fees: 2.5% + $0.30 per ticket
- Competitive with Eventbrite (3.5% + $1.59 per ticket for free events, 3.5% for paid events)

## Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Definition**: Total profit generated from an average customer over their entire relationship with the platform.

**Tier 1 (MVP) LTV Calculation**:
```
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): $750/month ($9,000/year)
Gross Margin: 65%
Retention Rate (Annual): 95% (5% annual churn)
Customer Lifespan: 1 / 0.05 = 20 years

LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × Lifespan
LTV = $9,000 × 0.65 × 20 = $117,000
```

**Tier 2 (Strategic) LTV Calculation**:
```
ARPU: $3,000/month ($36,000/year)
Gross Margin: 75%
Retention Rate: 97% (3% annual churn)
Customer Lifespan: 1 / 0.03 = 33 years

LTV = $36,000 × 0.75 × 33 = $891,000
```

**Tier 3 (Walled Garden) LTV Calculation**:
```
ARPU: $8,333/month ($100,000/year)
Gross Margin: 80%
Retention Rate: 98% (2% annual churn)
Customer Lifespan: 1 / 0.02 = 50 years

LTV = $100,000 × 0.80 × 50 = $4,000,000
```

---

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Definition**: Total cost to acquire one new customer (marketing + sales + onboarding).

**Tier 1 (MVP) CAC**:
```
Marketing Spend: $10,000/month (content, ads, conferences)
Sales Team: 1 person × $8,000/month (Brad, 60% allocation)
Onboarding: Included in professional services (revenue, not cost)

Monthly CAC Spend: $18,000
New Customers/Month: 10 (Year 1 ramp: 50 customers over 12 months, avg 4-5/month but peak at 10/month)

CAC = $18,000 / 10 = $1,800 per customer
```

**Tier 2 (Strategic) CAC**:
```
Marketing Spend: $200,000/month (expanded campaigns)
Sales Team: 10 people × $10,000/month avg (SDRs + AEs)
Onboarding: Handled by customer success team (separate budget)

Monthly CAC Spend: $300,000
New Customers/Month: 50

CAC = $300,000 / 50 = $6,000 per customer
```

**Tier 3 (Walled Garden) CAC**:
```
Marketing Spend: $2M/month (brand campaigns, conferences, partnerships)
Sales Team: 50 people × $12,000/month avg (global sales team)

Monthly CAC Spend: $2.6M
New Customers/Month: 150

CAC = $2,600,000 / 150 = $17,333 per customer
```

---

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Target**: >3:1 (healthy SaaS benchmark)

| Tier | LTV | CAC | LTV:CAC Ratio | Assessment |
|------|-----|-----|---------------|------------|
| **Tier 1 (MVP)** | $117,000 | $1,800 | **65:1** | ✅ Excellent (bootstrap-friendly) |
| **Tier 2 (Strategic)** | $891,000 | $6,000 | **148:1** | ✅ Excellent (high growth potential) |
| **Tier 3 (Walled Garden)** | $4,000,000 | $17,333 | **231:1** | ✅ Excellent (sustainable at scale) |

**Key Insight**: At all tiers, LTV:CAC ratio is exceptionally strong (50-200X), indicating a highly profitable business model with significant room for increased marketing investment.

---

### Payback Period

**Definition**: Time to recover CAC from gross profit.

**Tier 1 (MVP)**:
```
CAC: $1,800
Monthly Gross Profit: $750 × 0.65 = $487.50

Payback Period = $1,800 / $487.50 = 3.7 months
```

**Tier 2 (Strategic)**:
```
CAC: $6,000
Monthly Gross Profit: $3,000 × 0.75 = $2,250

Payback Period = $6,000 / $2,250 = 2.7 months
```

**Tier 3 (Walled Garden)**:
```
CAC: $17,333
Monthly Gross Profit: $8,333 × 0.80 = $6,666

Payback Period = $17,333 / $6,666 = 2.6 months
```

**Target**: <12 months (industry standard), <6 months (exceptional)

**Assessment**: All tiers achieve payback in <4 months (exceptional), enabling rapid reinvestment in growth.

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Price based on value delivered, not cost incurred.

**Value Drivers**:
1. **Cost savings**: Replacing 10-40 tools (save $1,000-8,000/month)

3. **Revenue generation**: Better donation management, event registration (increase revenue 10-20%)
