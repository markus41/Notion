## Executive Summary

Establish comprehensive task hierarchy spanning 10-year development lifecycle from Tier 1 MVP (9-12 months, $1.5M-2.5M) through Tier 2 Strategic Expansion (Years 2-5, $10M-20M) to Tier 3 Walled Garden (Years 5-10, $50M-100M+). This WBS defines 1,200+ tasks across 18 major work packages, providing granular visibility into dependencies, resource requirements, and critical path activities.

**Key Insights**:
- **Tier 1 MVP**: 6 phases, 48 weeks, 280 tasks, critical path through hierarchical membership → AI command palette
- **Tier 2 Strategic**: 12 features, 36 months, 520 tasks, parallel workstreams across 501(c) types
- **Tier 3 Walled Garden**: 28 additional features, 60 months, 420+ tasks, platform expansion

**Critical Path Milestones**:
- Month 3: Core membership + auth complete (foundation for all features)
- Month 6: Hierarchical content engine live (key differentiator)
- Month 9: AI command palette beta (flagship feature)
- Month 12: MVP launch with 50 beta customers

## Critical Path Analysis

### Tier 1 Critical Path (Weeks 1-48)

**Longest Path**: 38 weeks (9.5 months) without buffer

1. **Project Initiation** (4 weeks)
   - 1.1.1.1 → 1.1.1.3 → 1.1.2.1 → 1.1.2.2 (Requirements → Design)

2. **Core Infrastructure** (2 weeks, parallel but required for development)
   - 1.2.2.1 → 1.2.2.2 (Azure setup)

3. **Hierarchical Membership** (12 weeks) ← **CRITICAL PATH DRIVER**
   - 1.3.1.1 → 1.3.2.5 → 1.3.3.6 (Content inheritance is most complex feature)

4. **AI Command Palette** (10 weeks)
   - 1.5.1.1 → 1.5.1.3 → 1.5.2.1 → 1.5.3.1 → 1.5.4.1

5. **Beta Onboarding** (6 weeks)
   - 1.6.2.1 → 1.6.2.4 (Customer recruitment → training → usage)

6. **Launch** (2 weeks)
   - 1.6.4.1 → 1.6.4.4 (Deployment → announcement)

**Total Critical Path**: 36 weeks
**With 20% Schedule Buffer**: 43 weeks (~11 months)
**Target Completion**: Week 48 (12 months)

**Float Analysis**:
- Events Management (WP 1.4): 4 weeks float (can slip without impacting launch)
- Infrastructure (WP 1.2): 2 weeks float (mostly parallel)
- Testing (WP 1.6.1): 1 week float (can compress if needed)

---

### Tier 2 Critical Path (Months 13-48)

**Primary Dependencies**:
1. **501(c)(3) Features** (Months 13-24) → Must complete for Year 2 expansion
2. **FedRAMP Certification** (Months 25-48) → Must complete for federal contracts
3. **Mobile Apps** (Months 37-48) → Must complete for competitive parity

**Parallel Workstreams**:
- 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5) can develop in parallel with FedRAMP (no dependency)
- Advanced analytics can develop in parallel with certifications
- StateRAMP can proceed in parallel with FedRAMP (70% control overlap)

**Critical Milestone**: FedRAMP ATO by Month 48 (end of Year 4)
- If delayed, federal revenue opportunity slips 6-12 months
- Mitigation: Start FedRAMP process in Month 25 (Year 3 Q1), not later

---

### Tier 3 Critical Path (Months 49-120)

**Sequencing Logic**:
1. **Financial Services** must precede **Insurance** (need banking infrastructure)
2. **Healthcare** can parallel **Networking** (independent features)
3. **Data Intelligence** requires **all previous features** (needs data from entire platform)
4. **Exit Prep** is final phase (requires mature financials, customer base)

**Critical Milestone**: Year 9 (Month 108) - Begin IPO preparation
- Requires $3B+ ARR, positive EBITDA, Big 4 audited financials
- 24-month process to IPO or acquisition

## Risk & Contingency

### Schedule Risks

**Risk 1: Content Inheritance Complexity** (WP 1.3.2.5)
- **Impact**: 2-4 week slip in critical path
- **Probability**: 40%
- **Mitigation**: Prototype inheritance rules in Month 1, validate with 3 associations
- **Contingency**: Simplify inheritance rules (3 modes → 2 modes), defer advanced features to post-MVP

**Risk 2: AI Command Palette Accuracy** (WP 1.5.4.2)
- **Impact**: 2-6 week slip if accuracy <90%
- **Probability**: 30%
- **Mitigation**: Extensive prompt engineering in Months 6-7, synthetic data generation for training
- **Contingency**: Launch with limited command set (50 commands vs. 200), expand post-launch

**Risk 3: FedRAMP Delays** (WP 2.4.1)
- **Impact**: 6-12 month slip in federal revenue
- **Probability**: 60% (common for first-time applicants)
- **Mitigation**: Hire experienced FedRAMP consultant, start 6 months earlier than planned
- **Contingency**: Focus on state/local contracts, delay federal to Year 6

**Risk 4: Beta Customer Churn** (WP 1.6.2.4)
- **Impact**: Poor word-of-mouth, slower growth in Year 2
- **Probability**: 20% (10+ customers churn during beta)
- **Mitigation**: White-glove support, weekly check-ins, fast bug fixes
- **Contingency**: Offer 3 months free to churned customers to return, invest in customer success team

---

### Budget Risks

**Risk 1: Azure Costs Higher Than Expected** (WP 1.2.2)
- **Impact**: $50K-100K overage in Year 1
- **Probability**: 40%
- **Mitigation**: Implement autoscaling, reserved instances, cost alerts
- **Contingency**: Optimize queries, add caching, negotiate Azure commitment discount

**Risk 2: Third-Party API Costs** (WP 1.2.3, 1.5)
- **Impact**: $100K-200K overage (Auth0, Azure OpenAI)
- **Probability**: 50%
- **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting, caching, usage-based pricing
- **Contingency**: Switch to lower-cost alternatives (Auth0 → Azure AD B2C), negotiate volume discounts

**Risk 3: Security/Compliance Cost Overruns** (XWP-1, WP 2.4)
- **Impact**: $500K-1M overage (FedRAMP)
- **Probability**: 50%
- **Mitigation**: Fixed-price consultant contracts, detailed cost tracking
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline (reduce monthly burn), raise dedicated compliance funding

---

### Resource Risks

**Risk 1: Key Person Dependency** (Markus)
- **Impact**: Project stalls if Markus unavailable
- **Probability**: 10% (illness, attrition)
- **Mitigation**: Cross-training Alec and Mitch on critical components, document all architecture decisions
- **Contingency**: Hire senior architect contractor immediately, extend timeline 4-8 weeks

**Risk 2: Hiring Delays** (Tier 2, 3)
- **Impact**: 2-4 month slip per role
- **Probability**: 60% (competitive market)
- **Mitigation**: Start hiring 3 months before needed, build talent pipeline
- **Contingency**: Use contractors/agencies to fill gaps temporarily, extend timeline
