## Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Primary Research Questions

1. **Build vs. Buy Decision**
   - **Question**: Can existing AMS solutions (Wild Apricot, MemberClicks, etc.) plus customization meet our target customers' needs more cost-effectively than building from scratch?
   - **Hypothesis**: Existing solutions lack hierarchical content distribution and AI capabilities, creating defensible differentiation
   - **Success Criteria**: Identify ≥3 must-have features missing from all competitors

2. **Market Demand Validation**
   - **Question**: Will associations pay $299-4,999/month for unified AMS platform that replaces multiple tools?
   - **Hypothesis**: Associations currently spend $50-150K/year across fragmented vendors and would consolidate for 40-60% savings
   - **Success Criteria**: 8/10 interviewed associations express strong interest (7+ on 10-point scale)

3. **Technical Feasibility**
   - **Question**: Can we build hierarchical content distribution and AI command palette with current team skills and Azure infrastructure?
   - **Hypothesis**: Azure AI Search + Prisma ORM + Next.js can support multi-tenant, hierarchical architecture at scale
   - **Success Criteria**: POC demonstrates 3-level hierarchy with <100ms query time for 10,000 content items

4. **Competitive Positioning**
   - **Question**: What sustainable competitive advantages differentiate us from 50+ existing AMS platforms?
   - **Hypothesis**: Hierarchical content + AI interface + Microsoft-first architecture = unique value proposition
   - **Success Criteria**: Identify ≥2 unique features competitors cannot easily replicate

5. **Team Capacity Reality Check**
   - **Question**: Can Brookside BI team (5 people) dedicate 60-80% time for 9-12 months without killing existing Innovation Nexus momentum?
   - **Hypothesis**: Can archive 2-3 lower-priority builds and reallocate capacity
   - **Success Criteria**: Workload analysis shows <5 active items per team member after reallocation

### Week 2: Technical Proof of Concept

#### POC Objectives

1. **Validate Hierarchical Content Model**
   - Build 3-level organization structure (National → Regional → Local)
   - Implement content inheritance with override rules
   - Test query performance at scale

2. **Validate AI Command Palette**
   - Integrate Azure OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language understanding
   - Build intent recognition for 10 common actions
   - Measure response time (<2 seconds target)

3. **Validate Multi-Tenant Architecture**
   - Design row-level security pattern with Azure SQL
   - Test data isolation between organizations
   - Implement organizationId on all entities

#### POC Technology Stack

**Simplified Stack for POC**:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (local Docker)
- Azure OpenAI API
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components

**POC Scope** (80 hours development time):

**Week 2, Days 1-2**: Environment Setup
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Set up Azure OpenAI API access
- Basic authentication (mock for POC)

**Week 2, Days 3-4**: Hierarchical Content Model
```prisma
model Organization {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  name            String
  type            OrgType  // NATIONAL, REGIONAL, LOCAL
  parentId        String?
  parent          Organization? @relation("OrgHierarchy", fields: [parentId], references: [id])
  children        Organization[] @relation("OrgHierarchy")
  content         Content[]
}

model Content {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  title           String
  body            String
  organizationId  String
  organization    Organization @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id])
  inheritanceRule InheritanceRule  // OVERRIDE, APPEND, INHERIT
  visibility      Visibility  // ALL_LEVELS, SAME_LEVEL, CHILDREN_ONLY
}
```

- Implement content resolution algorithm:
  1. Query content at current org level
  2. If inheritanceRule = INHERIT, recursively fetch from parent
  3. Merge with local content based on rules
  4. Cache results (Redis pattern simulation)

- Performance Test:
  - Seed 100 organizations (10 national, 30 regional, 60 local)
  - Create 10,000 content items distributed across hierarchy
  - Measure query time for content resolution at local level
  - **Target**: <100ms for typical query, <500ms for complex inheritance

**Week 2, Day 5**: AI Command Palette
```typescript
// AI intent recognition
const commandPaletteHandler = async (userInput: string) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are an AMS assistant. Parse user commands into structured actions. Available actions: CREATE_EVENT, FIND_MEMBER, SEND_EMAIL, GENERATE_REPORT, SCHEDULE_MEETING..."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: userInput
      }
    ],
    functions: [
      {
        name: "execute_action",
        parameters: {
          action: { type: "string", enum: ["CREATE_EVENT", "FIND_MEMBER", ...] },
          parameters: { type: "object" }
        }
      }
    ]
  });

  // Execute parsed action
  return executeAction(response.function_call);
};
```

- Test 20 sample commands:
  - "Schedule committee meeting next Tuesday at 2pm"
  - "Find all members who haven't renewed"
  - "Create event for annual conference in Chicago"
  - "Show me revenue by membership tier"
  - Etc.

- Measure:
  - Intent recognition accuracy (>90% target)
  - Response time (<2s target)
  - User experience (does it feel magical?)

**Deliverable**: Working POC with demo video (5 minutes) showing hierarchical content + AI palette in action

- **Total Investment**: $30-50K
- **Total 5-Year Revenue**: $2-5M (assumes 100-200 customers by Year 5)

**Conclusion**: Build scenario has highest upfront investment BUT creates reusable asset with massive revenue potential. Buy scenarios have lower risk but no asset creation.

#### Feature Gap Analysis

**Must-Have Features Missing from ALL Competitors**:
1. ✅ **Hierarchical Content Distribution** - None support complex org structures effectively
2. ✅ **AI-Powered Command Palette** - No competitor has natural language interface
3. ✅ **Deep Microsoft Ecosystem Integration** - Most have basic SSO, none have Teams/SharePoint/Outlook bidirectional sync
4. ⚠️ **Advanced Donation Management** - Fonteva has good version, but expensive enterprise-only

**Features We Must Build to Match Competitors**:
- Website builder (Wild Apricot strength)
- Email marketing (all competitors have this)
- Mobile app (some competitors)
- Social network / member directory (most have basic version)

**Strategic Decision**: Build MVP focused on unique differentiators, integrate with best-of-breed for commodity features (email marketing = Mailchimp integration, etc.)

**Deliverable**: Build vs. Buy Decision Matrix with clear recommendation

- Why did research reveal low viability?
- What assumptions were incorrect?
- What would need to change for viability?

**Alternative Paths**:
1. **Pivot**: Focus on single unique differentiator (e.g., hierarchical content as standalone product)
2. **Partner**: White-label existing AMS, add our unique features on top
3. **Niche**: Target single 501(c) type (e.g., only trade associations)
4. **Archive**: Preserve learnings in Knowledge Vault, pursue different opportunity

**Update Notion**:
- Ideas Registry → Status: ⚫ Not Active, Viability: 🔻 Low
- Research Hub → Status: ✅ Completed, Next Steps: Archive
- Knowledge Vault → Create case study: "AMS Platform Feasibility - Why We Decided Not to Build"
