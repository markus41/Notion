### Viability Assessment

**Score: 35/100 (LOW) - NOT VIABLE with current resources**

**Critical Blockers**:
1. ‚ùå Unrealistic with 5-person team (requires 100-200 engineers)
2. ‚ùå $50-100M+ investment unavailable (requires IPO or massive VC funding)
3. ‚ùå 10-year timeline assumes perfect execution (high uncertainty)
4. ‚ùå Building 40+ tools is nearly impossible (acquisitions more likely)
5. ‚ùå Competitive moat erodes over time (every feature increases attack surface)

**Scoring Breakdown**:

| Criterion | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Market Demand | 7/10 | Market exists but associations may not want single vendor for EVERYTHING |
| Competitive Differentiation | 4/10 | By Year 5-10, competitors will copy unique features; differentiation erodes |
| Technical Feasibility | 3/10 | Building 40+ tools is extremely complex; integration overhead massive |
| Team Capacity & Capability | 2/10 | Requires 100-200 engineers; current team of 5 cannot scale to this |
| Financial Viability | 4/10 | $50-100M investment required; no clear path to funding this scale |
| Strategic Alignment | 6/10 | Aligns with vision but execution risk is enormous |
| Risk Profile | 2/10 | Catastrophic failure risk (overextension, cash burn, talent acquisition) |
| Regulatory & Compliance | 5/10 | More regulations as scope expands (banking, insurance, healthcare) |
| Go-to-Market Feasibility | 5/10 | Existing base helps, but switching 40+ tools is hard sell |
| Sustainability & Maintenance | 3/10 | Maintenance burden becomes overwhelming (40+ codebases, integrations) |
| **TOTAL** | **35/100** | **LOW** üîª - Not viable |

**Recommendation**:
- ‚úÖ **Document as strategic vision** - Excellent for investor pitches, long-term planning
- ‚ùå **DO NOT attempt to build immediately** - Unrealistic with current resources
- üí° **Revisit in Year 5+** - After Tier 2 success, consider strategic acquisitions vs. build

**Value of Tier 3 Vision**:
- Shows investors the massive TAM ($500M-1B ARR potential)
- Demonstrates strategic thinking and ambition
- Provides roadmap for acquisitions (buy competitors with specific features)
- Guides product roadmap prioritization (which features unlock Tier 3 path?)
