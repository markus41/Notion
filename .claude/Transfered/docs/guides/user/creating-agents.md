# Creating and Configuring AI Agents

**Best for:** Organizations establishing AI agent infrastructure to streamline workflows, improve visibility into operations, and drive measurable business outcomes across teams.

This comprehensive guide establishes clear operational pathways for creating, configuring, and managing AI agents from initial setup through production deployment. Designed to reduce onboarding time by 60% and support teams scaling agent operations across business environments.

## Overview

### What Are AI Agents in Agent Studio?

AI agents in Agent Studio are autonomous, purpose-built entities that leverage Azure OpenAI to perform specialized tasks within orchestrated workflows. Each agent is designed to:

- **Execute specific tasks**: Code generation, architecture design, validation, documentation
- **Integrate seamlessly**: Work independently or collaborate in multi-agent workflows
- **Maintain observability**: Provide full tracing, metrics, and execution visibility
- **Recover gracefully**: Built-in error handling, retries, and checkpointing
- **Scale reliably**: Handle varying workloads with consistent performance

### When to Create a New Agent vs Using Existing Ones

**Create a New Agent When:**
- You have unique business requirements not addressed by existing agents
- Custom system prompts or specialized knowledge is needed
- Different Azure OpenAI model configurations are required
- Team-specific agents with unique governance requirements

**Use Existing Agents When:**
- Standard tasks align with existing agent capabilities
- Consistent behavior across teams is desired
- Reducing operational complexity is a priority
- Cost optimization through shared resources

### Understanding Agent Types

Agent Studio provides four meta-agent types, each optimized for specific workflow stages:

| Agent Type | Primary Function | Best Use Cases | Typical Outputs |
|------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Architect** | Strategic planning and design | System architecture, technical planning, requirement analysis | Architecture diagrams, design documents, technical specifications |
| **Builder** | Code and artifact generation | Feature implementation, code creation, configuration generation | Source code, configuration files, scripts, infrastructure definitions |
| **Validator** | Quality assurance and testing | Code review, security validation, compliance checks | Test reports, validation results, issue findings |
| **Scribe** | Documentation creation | API docs, user guides, technical writing | Documentation files, API specifications, runbooks |

**Selection Guidelines:**

### Step 4: Configure Advanced Settings

Advanced settings control how your agent interacts with Azure OpenAI and handles execution.

#### Azure OpenAI Model Configuration

**Model Selection:**

Select the appropriate Azure OpenAI model for your use case:

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons | Cost (per 1K tokens) |
|-------|----------|------|------|---------------------|
| **GPT-4** | Complex reasoning, critical accuracy | Highest quality, best reasoning | Slower, more expensive | $0.03 (input) / $0.06 (output) |
| **GPT-4-Turbo** | Balanced performance and cost | Good quality, faster than GPT-4 | Moderate cost | $0.01 (input) / $0.03 (output) |
| **GPT-3.5-Turbo** | High-volume, simpler tasks | Fast, cost-effective | Less sophisticated reasoning | $0.0015 (input) / $0.002 (output) |

**Selection Guidelines:**

**Choose GPT-4 for:**

- Security validation and compliance checks
- Scenarios where cost is secondary to quality

**Choose GPT-4-Turbo for:**
- Balanced workloads requiring good quality at moderate cost
- Most production use cases
- Multi-step workflows where speed matters
- General-purpose agent tasks

**Choose GPT-3.5-Turbo for:**
- High-volume, repetitive tasks
- Simple documentation generation
- Cost-sensitive environments
- Development and testing environments

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "model": {
    "deploymentName": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "apiVersion": "2024-02-15-preview"
  }
}
```

---

#### Model Parameters

Configure how the AI model generates responses:

**Temperature (0.0 - 2.0):**
- **Purpose**: Controls randomness and creativity
- **Default**: 0.7

**Recommended Values:**

| Temperature | Behavior | Best For |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **0.0 - 0.3** | Deterministic, consistent, focused | Code generation, validation, factual tasks |
| **0.4 - 0.7** | Balanced creativity and consistency | Architecture design, documentation, general use |
| **0.8 - 1.0** | Creative, diverse, exploratory | Brainstorming, ideation, multiple solutions |
| **1.1 - 2.0** | Highly creative, less predictable | Experimental, creative writing (rarely used) |

**Examples:**
```json
// Code generation (deterministic)
{ "temperature": 0.2 }

// Architecture design (balanced)
{ "temperature": 0.7 }

// Brainstorming (creative)
{ "temperature": 0.9 }
```

---

**Max Tokens (1 - 128,000):**
- **Purpose**: Maximum length of response (in tokens)
- **Default**: 4,000 tokens
- **Note**: ~750 words = ~1,000 tokens

**Recommended Values:**

| Token Limit | Output Length | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **500-1,000** | Short response | Simple queries, brief explanations |
| **2,000-4,000** | Medium response | Standard code generation, API docs |
| **4,000-8,000** | Long response | Complex architectures, comprehensive docs |
| **8,000+** | Very long response | Detailed specifications, large codebases |

**Cost Consideration:** Higher token limits increase costs. Set to the minimum needed for your use case.

---

**Top P (0.0 - 1.0):**
- **Purpose**: Nucleus sampling - alternative to temperature
- **Default**: 0.95
- **Recommendation**: Use either temperature OR top_p, not both

**Frequency Penalty (0.0 - 2.0):**
- **Purpose**: Reduces repetition of tokens based on frequency
- **Default**: 0.0
- **When to Adjust**: Increase (0.3-0.5) if responses are repetitive

**Presence Penalty (0.0 - 2.0):**
- **Purpose**: Encourages topic diversity
- **Default**: 0.0
- **When to Adjust**: Increase (0.3-0.5) for broader exploration

---

**Complete Parameter Configuration Example:**

```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "maxTokens": 4000,
    "topP": 0.95,
    "frequencyPenalty": 0.2,
    "presencePenalty": 0.1,
    "stopSequences": []
  }
}
```

---

#### Execution Configuration

**Timeout Settings:**
- **Task Timeout**: Maximum execution time for single task (default: 120 seconds)
- **Workflow Timeout**: Maximum time for entire workflow (default: 1800 seconds)

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "taskTimeoutSeconds": 120,
    "workflowTimeoutSeconds": 1800
  }
}
```

**Adjust timeouts based on:**
- Task complexity (more complex = longer timeout)
- Model speed (GPT-4 slower than GPT-3.5-Turbo)
- Expected response length (longer responses need more time)

---

#### Retry Configuration

**Purpose**: Automatically retry failed executions with exponential backoff.

```json
{
  "retryPolicy": {
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "initialDelayMs": 1000,
    "maxDelayMs": 30000,
    "exponentialBackoff": true,
    "retryOnStatusCodes": [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

- **maxRetries** (0-10): Number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- **initialDelayMs** (100-10000): Initial wait before first retry (default: 1000ms)
- **maxDelayMs** (1000-60000): Maximum wait between retries (default: 30000ms)
- **exponentialBackoff** (true/false): Double delay after each retry (default: true)
- **retryOnStatusCodes**: HTTP status codes that trigger retries

**Best Practices:**
- Enable retries for production agents (recommended: 3-5 retries)
- Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming services
- Don't retry on 4xx errors (client errors) - only 5xx (server errors) and 429 (rate limits)

---

#### Rate Limiting

**Purpose**: Prevent agents from exceeding Azure OpenAI quotas.

```json
{
  "rateLimit": {
    "requestsPerMinute": 60,
    "tokensPerMinute": 90000,
    "concurrentRequests": 10
  }
}
```

**Configuration Guidelines:**

Match your Azure OpenAI deployment quotas:

| Deployment Type | Typical TPM | Recommended Agent Settings |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **GPT-4 Standard** | 10K TPM | `tokensPerMinute: 8000` |
| **GPT-4-Turbo Standard** | 30K TPM | `tokensPerMinute: 25000` |
| **GPT-3.5-Turbo Standard** | 60K TPM | `tokensPerMinute: 50000` |
| **GPT-4 Enterprise** | 300K+ TPM | `tokensPerMinute: 250000` |

**Important:** Set agent limits below deployment limits to prevent rate limit errors.

---

**Click "Next: System Prompt" to continue.**

#### Test Your Agent

**Test Suite Recommendations:**

Run these test scenarios before production deployment:

**Test 1: Happy Path**
- Input: Standard task the agent will frequently handle
- Expected: Complete, properly formatted response within timeout
- Pass Criteria: Response meets all format requirements

**Test 2: Edge Case**
- Input: Unusual or complex variant of typical task
- Expected: Agent handles gracefully, provides reasonable output
- Pass Criteria: No errors, appropriate response quality

**Test 3: Invalid Input**
- Input: Malformed or incomplete task description
- Expected: Agent requests clarification or handles gracefully
- Pass Criteria: No crash, helpful error message

**Test 4: Performance**
- Input: Complex task near expected maximum complexity
- Expected: Completes within timeout, uses reasonable tokens
- Pass Criteria: Execution time < 80% of timeout, token usage < max

**Test 5: Consistency**
- Input: Same task repeated 3 times
- Expected: Similar outputs (for low temperature settings)
- Pass Criteria: Key content consistent across runs

---

**Running Tests:**

1. Navigate to **"Test"** tab in agent configuration
2. For each test scenario:
   ```json
   {
     "testName": "Happy Path - Architecture Design",
     "input": {
       "task": "Design a microservices architecture for inventory management",
       "context": {
         "scale": "1M requests/day",
         "technology": "Azure",
         "requirements": ["real-time updates", "high availability"]
       }
     },
     "expectedBehavior": "Complete architecture with diagrams and component breakdown"
   }
   ```
3. Click **"Run Test"**
4. Review output:
   - ✅ Response quality
   - ✅ Format compliance
   - ✅ Execution time
   - ✅ Token usage
   - ✅ Error handling

5. Document test results:
   ```markdown
   ## Test Results: [Agent Name]
   Date: [Date]
   Tester: [Your name]

   | Test | Status | Execution Time | Tokens | Notes |
   |------|--------|----------------|--------|-------|
   | Happy Path | ✅ Pass | 45s | 2,300 | Excellent quality |
   | Edge Case | ✅ Pass | 67s | 3,100 | Handled gracefully |
   | Invalid Input | ✅ Pass | 5s | 200 | Clear error message |
   | Performance | ✅ Pass | 89s | 4,500 | Within limits |
   | Consistency | ⚠️ Warning | 44s avg | 2,250 avg | Some variation (expected with temp=0.7) |

   **Overall Assessment:** Ready for staging deployment
   **Recommendations:** Monitor token usage in production
   ```

---

#### Common Test Failures and Fixes

**Issue: Timeout Errors**
- **Cause**: Max tokens too high, complex task, slow model
- **Fix**: Reduce maxTokens, increase timeout, or use faster model (GPT-4-Turbo)

**Issue: Inconsistent Outputs**
- **Cause**: Temperature too high
- **Fix**: Reduce temperature to 0.3-0.5 for consistency

**Issue: Incomplete Responses**
- **Cause**: Max tokens too low
- **Fix**: Increase maxTokens to 6000-8000

**Issue: Poor Quality Outputs**
- **Cause**: Vague system prompt, wrong model
- **Fix**: Make system prompt more specific, add examples, consider upgrading to GPT-4

**Issue: Rate Limit Errors**
- **Cause**: Rate limits too high for Azure OpenAI deployment
- **Fix**: Reduce requestsPerMinute and tokensPerMinute in rate limit configuration

2. Set sunset date (recommended: 30-90 days)
3. Add deprecation notice:
   ```
   This agent is deprecated and will be removed on 2025-12-31.
   Please migrate to: architect-agent-v2
   Migration guide: [link]
   ```
4. Deprecated agents show warning banner

**Step 2: Notify Users**
- Email notification sent to all agent users
- Banner appears when viewing/using agent
- Dashboard shows deprecated agents list

**Step 3: Monitor Usage**
- Track executions during deprecation period
- Identify users still using deprecated agent
- Reach out to help with migration

**Step 4: Disable Agent**
- On sunset date, disable agent (can't execute new tasks)
- Existing workflows fail gracefully with clear message
- Execution history preserved

**Step 5: Delete Agent**
- After 30 days disabled, delete permanently
- **Warning**: Cannot be undone
- All configuration and history archived

---

**Deleting Agents:**

**When to Delete:**
- Agent no longer needed
- Failed experiment or prototype
- Replaced by better version
- Consolidating duplicate agents

**How to Delete:**

1. Agent Details → Settings → **"Delete Agent"**
2. Confirmation dialog:
   ```
   ⚠️ Delete Agent: payment-api-builder-dev

   This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete:
   - Agent configuration
   - Execution history (75 executions)
   - Associated metrics and logs

   Workflows using this agent will fail. Affected workflows: 3

   Type agent name to confirm: [_________________________]

   [Cancel] [Delete Permanently]
   ```
3. Type agent name to confirm
4. Click **"Delete Permanently"**
5. Agent deleted immediately

**Best Practice:** Deprecate before deleting to give users migration time.

## Common Issues and Solutions

This section addresses frequent issues users encounter when creating and using agents.

### Agent Configuration Issues

#### Issue: Agent Returns Incomplete Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Responses cut off mid-sentence
- Missing expected sections
- Output feels truncated

**Causes:**
1. `maxTokens` limit too low
2. Response naturally exceeding token limit
3. Model hitting context window limit

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Increase maxTokens**
```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "maxTokens": 8000  // Increase from default 4000
  }
}
```

**Solution 2: Break Task into Smaller Subtasks**
Instead of:
```
"Design complete e-commerce platform with all features"
```

Use workflow with multiple steps:
```
Step 1: "Design user authentication architecture"
Step 2: "Design product catalog architecture"
Step 3: "Design order processing architecture"
Step 4: "Design payment integration architecture"
```

**Solution 3: Request Structured Output**
Update system prompt to request concise, structured output:
```markdown
Provide responses in this structure:
1. Summary (max 200 words)
2. Key Components (bullet list)
3. Architecture Diagram (Mermaid)
4. Next Steps (numbered list)

Be concise. Focus on essential information.
```

---

#### Issue: Inconsistent Agent Behavior

**Symptoms:**
- Different outputs for identical inputs
- Unpredictable response quality
- Can't reproduce results

**Causes:**
1. High `temperature` setting causing randomness
2. Vague or ambiguous system prompt
3. Insufficient context in tasks

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Lower Temperature**
```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "temperature": 0.2  // Reduce from 0.7 for consistency
  }
}
```

Effect: More deterministic, repeatable outputs

**Solution 2: Clarify System Prompt**
❌ Vague:
```
You are helpful and create good architectures.
```

✅ Specific:
```
You are a cloud architect specializing in Azure microservices.
Always provide:
1. Component diagram (Mermaid format)
2. Technology stack with specific versions
3. Scalability analysis with metrics
4. Cost estimate with Azure pricing

Use consistent terminology: "service" not "module" or "component"
```

**Solution 3: Provide More Context**
❌ Minimal context:
```
{ "task": "Design authentication system" }
```

✅ Rich context:
```json
{
  "task": "Design authentication system",
  "context": {
    "userBase": "100K users",
    "authenticationType": "OAuth 2.0 + JWT",
    "providers": ["Azure AD", "Google", "Email/Password"],
    "securityRequirements": ["MFA", "RBAC", "Audit logs"],
    "existingStack": "Azure, .NET Core, React",
    "scalabilityTarget": "10K concurrent auth requests"
  }
}
```

---

#### Issue: Agent Takes Too Long to Respond

**Symptoms:**
- Execution exceeds expected time
- Frequent timeout errors
- Poor user experience

**Causes:**
1. `maxTokens` set too high
2. Complex task requiring extensive computation
3. Model selection (GPT-4 slower than GPT-3.5-Turbo)
4. Azure OpenAI throttling

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Optimize maxTokens**
```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "maxTokens": 2000  // Reduce from 8000 if appropriate
  }
}
```

**Solution 2: Use Faster Model**
For non-critical tasks:
```json
{
  "azureOpenAI": {
    "deploymentName": "gpt-35-turbo"  // 5-10x faster than GPT-4
  }
}
```

**Solution 3: Increase Timeout**
If task legitimately needs more time:
```json
{
  "execution": {
    "taskTimeoutSeconds": 180  // Increase from 120
  }
}
```

**Solution 4: Check Azure OpenAI Quotas**
```bash
# Verify you're not hitting rate limits
az monitor metrics list \
  --resource /subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{name} \
  --metric "TokenTransaction" \
  --start-time 2025-10-09T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2025-10-09T23:59:59Z
```

---

### Execution Errors

#### Issue: "Rate Limit Exceeded" Errors

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 429 errors
- "Rate limit exceeded" messages
- Tasks fail during peak usage

**Causes:**
1. Exceeding Azure OpenAI deployment quota (TPM - Tokens Per Minute)
2. Too many concurrent requests
3. Burst traffic patterns

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Verify Current Quota**
```bash
# Check Azure OpenAI quota
az cognitiveservices account deployment show \
  --name your-openai-resource \
  --resource-group your-rg \
  --deployment-name gpt-4
```

**Solution 2: Adjust Agent Rate Limits**
Match agent limits to deployment quotas (with buffer):
```json
{
  "rateLimit": {
    "tokensPerMinute": 8000,  // Set below deployment limit (e.g., 10K)
    "requestsPerMinute": 30,
    "concurrentRequests": 5
  }
}
```

**Solution 3: Implement Request Queuing**
Enable built-in request queue:
```json
{
  "execution": {
    "enableRequestQueue": true,
    "maxQueueSize": 100,
    "queueTimeoutSeconds": 300
  }
}
```

**Solution 4: Request Quota Increase**
```bash
# Request quota increase via Azure Support
# Or upgrade to higher SKU:
az cognitiveservices account update \
  --name your-openai-resource \
  --resource-group your-rg \
  --sku S1  # Higher tier = higher quota
```

**Solution 5: Distribute Load**
- Create multiple Azure OpenAI deployments
- Configure agent to round-robin between endpoints
- Use different regions for geo-distribution

---

#### Issue: "Authentication Failed" Errors

**Symptoms:**
- 401 Unauthorized errors
- "Invalid API key" messages
- Tasks fail immediately on execution

**Causes:**
1. API key not found in Key Vault
2. Key Vault reference incorrect
3. Key expired or rotated
4. Insufficient permissions to access Key Vault

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Verify Key Vault Secret**
```bash
# Check if secret exists
az keyvault secret show \
  --vault-name your-keyvault \
  --name openai-api-key
```

**Solution 2: Fix Key Vault Reference**
Ensure correct format:
```json
{
  "apiKeyReference": "@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://your-vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/openai-key/)"
}
```

**Solution 3: Check Permissions**
Agent service identity needs "Key Vault Secrets User" role:
```bash
# Grant permission
az keyvault set-policy \
  --name your-keyvault \
  --object-id {agent-service-identity-id} \
  --secret-permissions get list
```

**Solution 4: Rotate Key if Compromised**
```bash
# Generate new key in Azure OpenAI
# Update Key Vault secret
az keyvault secret set \
  --vault-name your-keyvault \
  --name openai-api-key \
  --value {new-key}

# No need to update agent config (reference remains same)
```

---

#### Issue: "Timeout" Errors During Execution

**Symptoms:**
- Tasks fail with timeout errors
- Execution reaches configured timeout limit
- No response received from agent

**Causes:**
1. Task too complex for timeout duration
2. Azure OpenAI service latency
3. Network connectivity issues
4. maxTokens set too high

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Increase Timeout**
```json
{
  "execution": {
    "taskTimeoutSeconds": 240  // Increase from 120
  }
}
```

**Solution 2: Reduce Scope**
Break complex task into smaller steps:
```
❌ Single Task:
"Design, implement, test, and document complete authentication system"

✅ Multiple Tasks (Workflow):
Task 1: "Design authentication system architecture"
Task 2: "Implement authentication API endpoints"
Task 3: "Create unit tests for authentication"
Task 4: "Generate API documentation"
```

**Solution 3: Optimize Token Usage**
```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "maxTokens": 3000  // Reduce from 8000
  }
}
```

**Solution 4: Check Azure Service Health**
```bash
# Verify Azure OpenAI service status
az monitor metrics list \
  --resource {openai-resource-id} \
  --metric "Latency" \
  --start-time 2025-10-09T14:00:00Z
```

**Solution 5: Enable Streaming**
For better user experience (user sees partial results):
```json
{
  "execution": {
    "streamingEnabled": true
  }
}
```

---

### Cost and Performance Issues

#### Issue: High Token Costs

**Symptoms:**
- Azure bills higher than expected
- Token usage exceeding budgets
- Cost alerts triggered

**Causes:**
1. Verbose system prompts consuming input tokens
2. Using GPT-4 for simple tasks
3. No token limits configured
4. Inefficient task descriptions

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Optimize System Prompt**
Remove redundant context:

❌ Verbose (500 tokens):
```markdown
You are an experienced software engineer with 15 years of experience
working across many different technologies including Python, Java, C++,
JavaScript, and many others. You have worked at top companies like
Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. You are an expert in design
patterns, algorithms, data structures, system design, and software
architecture. You have deep knowledge of...
[continues for many more lines]
```

✅ Concise (100 tokens):
```markdown
You are a senior software engineer specializing in Python API development.
Generate production-ready code with error handling and tests.
Output format: 1) Code, 2) Tests, 3) Usage example
```

**Solution 2: Use Appropriate Model**
Match model to task complexity:

| Task Complexity | Model | Cost per 1K tokens | When to Use |
|----------------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Simple | GPT-3.5-Turbo | $0.0015 | Documentation, simple code |
| Moderate | GPT-4-Turbo | $0.01 | Most production tasks |
| Complex | GPT-4 | $0.03 | Critical architecture, security |

**Solution 3: Set Token Budgets**
```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "maxTokens": 3000  // Strict limit
  },
  "rateLimit": {
    "tokensPerMinute": 30000  // Monthly budget enforcement
  }
}
```

**Solution 4: Enable Cost Alerts**
```bash
# Set up Azure Cost Management alert
az consumption budget create \
  --budget-name agent-studio-monthly \
  --amount 1000 \
  --category Cost \
  --time-grain Monthly \
  --notification-threshold 80
```

**Solution 5: Analyze Token Usage Patterns**
```kusto
// Application Insights query for token analysis
customMetrics
| where name == "AgentTokenUsage"
| extend agentId = tostring(customDimensions.agentId)
| extend inputTokens = toint(customDimensions.inputTokens)
| extend outputTokens = toint(customDimensions.outputTokens)
| summarize
    TotalInput = sum(inputTokens),
    TotalOutput = sum(outputTokens),
    AvgInput = avg(inputTokens),
    AvgOutput = avg(outputTokens),
    Cost = (sum(inputTokens) * 0.00003) + (sum(outputTokens) * 0.00006)
    by agentId
| order by Cost desc
```

Identify top cost drivers and optimize those agents first.

## Best Practices

### Agent Design Principles

**1. Single Responsibility**
Each agent should have one clear, well-defined purpose.

❌ Don't:
```
Agent: "Universal Development Agent"
Purpose: "Does everything - design, code, test, deploy, document"
```

✅ Do:
```
Agent: "Python API Builder"
Purpose: "Generates Python FastAPI endpoints with validation and tests"

Agent: "Security Validator"
Purpose: "Reviews code for security vulnerabilities"
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier to maintain and improve
- More predictable behavior
- Clearer usage guidelines
- Better troubleshooting

---

**2. Clear Interface Definition**
Define explicit inputs, outputs, and behavior.

**System Prompt Template:**
```markdown
# Input Requirements
You will receive:
- **task** (string): Description of what to build
- **context.technology** (string): Technology stack (e.g., "Python FastAPI")
- **context.requirements** (array): List of functional requirements

# Output Format
You must provide:
1. **Implementation**: Complete code in markdown code block
2. **Tests**: Unit tests in separate code block
3. **Dependencies**: List of required packages
4. **Usage**: Example showing how to use the implementation

# Example
Input: {example input}
Output: {example output}
```

---

**3. Composability**
Design agents to work seamlessly in workflows.

**Output Compatibility:**
Ensure agent outputs can be consumed by subsequent agents:

```yaml
Workflow: "Feature Development"
Step 1: Architect Agent
  Output: { "architecture": {...}, "components": [...] }

Step 2: Builder Agent
  Input: { "architecture": from_step_1 }
  Output: { "code": {...}, "tests": {...} }

Step 3: Validator Agent
  Input: { "code": from_step_2 }
  Output: { "issues": [...], "approval": boolean }
```

**Interface Contracts:**
Document what each agent produces:
```json
{
  "agentType": "Architect",
  "outputSchema": {
    "architecture": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "components": "array",
        "dataFlow": "string",
        "techStack": "object"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

**4. Idempotency**
Agents should produce consistent results for identical inputs (where temperature is low).

**Test Idempotency:**
```python
def test_agent_idempotency():
    task = {
        "task": "Generate user registration API endpoint",
        "context": {"language": "Python", "framework": "FastAPI"}
    }

    # Execute same task 3 times
    result1 = agent.execute(task)
    result2 = agent.execute(task)
    result3 = agent.execute(task)

    # Results should be functionally equivalent
    assert result1["structure"] == result2["structure"] == result3["structure"]
    assert result1["endpoint"] == result2["endpoint"] == result3["endpoint"]
```

**Configuration for Idempotency:**
```json
{
  "modelParameters": {
    "temperature": 0.2,  // Low for consistency
    "seed": 12345  // Optional: Deterministic seed
  }
}
```

---

**5. Error Handling**
Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery.

**System Prompt Error Handling:**
```markdown
# Error Handling

If the task is unclear or missing required information:
1. Identify specific missing information
2. Provide a structured error response:
   {
     "error": "MissingRequirement",
     "message": "Cannot proceed without technology stack specification",
     "required": ["context.technology"],
     "suggestions": ["Python", "Node.js", "Java"]
   }

Never attempt to guess or make assumptions about critical requirements.
```

**Retry Configuration:**
```json
{
  "retryPolicy": {
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "exponentialBackoff": true,
    "retryOnStatusCodes": [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
  }
}
```

---

**6. Observability**
Instrument all agent operations with tracing and metrics.

**Enable Comprehensive Monitoring:**
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "enableTracing": true,
    "enableMetrics": true,
    "logLevel": "Info",
    "customMetrics": [
      "task_complexity",
      "output_quality_score",
      "user_satisfaction"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Structured Logging in System Prompt:**
```markdown
# Logging Requirements

Log key decisions and reasoning steps:
- "Analyzing requirement: [requirement]"
- "Selected pattern: [pattern] because [reason]"
- "Generated component: [component] with [details]"

This helps troubleshooting and quality improvement.
```

---

### Configuration Management

**1. Version Control**
Store agent configurations in Git repositories.

**Repository Structure:**
```
agent-configurations/
├── production/
│   ├── architect-agent-prod.json
│   ├── builder-agent-prod.json
│   ├── validator-agent-prod.json
│   └── scribe-agent-prod.json
├── staging/
│   └── [staging agents]
├── development/
│   └── [dev agents]
└── README.md
```

**Track Changes:**
```bash
# Commit agent configuration changes
git add production/architect-agent-prod.json
git commit -m "feat: Update architect agent with cost optimization prompts

- Reduced system prompt tokens by 40%
- Added explicit cost consideration requirements
- Updated output format for consistency

Impact: Expected 25% cost reduction with maintained quality"
```

---

**2. Environment Parity**
Maintain consistent configurations across environments.

**Configuration Template:**
```json
{
  "name": "architect-agent-{{environment}}",
  "environment": "{{environment}}",
  "azureOpenAI": {
    "deploymentName": "{{model-deployment}}",
    "apiKeyReference": "{{key-vault-reference}}"
  },
  "modelParameters": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxTokens": "{{max-tokens}}"
  }
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Development
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-35-turbo
MAX_TOKENS=2000

# Production
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4-turbo
MAX_TOKENS=8000
```

---

**3. Configuration as Code**
Use infrastructure as code practices.

**Terraform Example:**
```hcl
resource "agent_studio_agent" "architect_prod" {
  name        = "architect-agent-prod"
  type        = "Architect"
  description = var.architect_description
  environment = "Production"

  azure_openai {
    endpoint        = data.azurerm_cognitive_account.openai.endpoint
    deployment_name = "gpt-4-turbo"
    api_key_ref     = data.azurerm_key_vault_secret.openai_key.id
  }

  model_parameters {
    temperature  = 0.7
    max_tokens   = 8000
    top_p        = 0.95
  }

  retry_policy {
    max_retries        = 3
    exponential_backoff = true
  }

  system_prompt = file("${path.module}/prompts/architect-agent.md")

  tags = {
    team        = "platform"
    cost_center = "engineering"
    criticality = "high"
  }
}
```

---

**4. Secrets Management**
Never commit secrets—use Key Vault exclusively.

**DO NOT:**
```json
{
  "apiKey": "sk-proj-abc123..."  // ❌ NEVER DO THIS
}
```

**DO:**
```json
{
  "apiKeyReference": "@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/key/)"
}
```

**Secret Rotation:**
```bash
# Rotate secrets regularly (e.g., every 90 days)
az keyvault secret set-attributes \
  --vault-name your-vault \
  --name openai-key \
  --expires $(date -d '+90 days' --iso-8601)

# Automated rotation with Azure Key Vault
az keyvault secret set \
  --vault-name your-vault \
  --name openai-key-new \
  --value {new-key}

# Update reference in agent config (automated)
# Old key expires automatically after 30-day grace period
```

---

**5. Documentation**
Document all configuration decisions and rationale.

**Agent Documentation Template:**
```markdown
# Architect Agent - Production Configuration

## Overview
**Purpose**: Designs scalable cloud architectures for production systems
**Owner**: Platform Team (platform-team@example.com)
**Created**: 2025-09-01
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09

## Configuration Decisions

### Model Selection: GPT-4-Turbo
**Rationale**: Balanced performance and cost for architecture tasks
**Alternatives Considered**: GPT-4 (too expensive), GPT-3.5-Turbo (insufficient quality)
**Cost Impact**: ~$0.10 per task vs $0.25 for GPT-4

### Temperature: 0.7
**Rationale**: Allows creative exploration while maintaining consistency
**Testing**: A/B tested 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 - 0.7 optimal for architecture variety

### Max Tokens: 8000
**Rationale**: Architecture designs typically require 4000-6000 tokens
**Buffer**: 8000 provides safety margin without waste

## Known Issues
- Occasionally exceeds token limit on very complex architectures
  **Workaround**: Break into multiple tasks for systems with >10 services

## Performance Metrics
- Average Execution Time: 52 seconds
- Success Rate: 97.3%
- Average Token Usage: 5,200 tokens
- Cost per Task: $0.11

## Change History
- 2025-10-09: Reduced system prompt tokens by 40% (cost optimization)
- 2025-09-15: Added explicit security requirements to prompt
- 2025-09-01: Initial creation
```

---

### Testing Strategy

**1. Unit Testing**
Test agent behavior with representative inputs.

```python
import pytest
from agent_studio import Agent

@pytest.fixture
def architect_agent():
    return Agent.load("architect-agent-prod")

def test_microservices_architecture_design(architect_agent):
    """Test agent can design microservices architecture"""
    task = {
        "task": "Design microservices architecture for inventory management",
        "context": {
            "scale": "1M requests/day",
            "services": ["inventory", "orders", "notifications"],
            "technology": "Azure"
        }
    }

    result = architect_agent.execute(task)

    # Validate structure
    assert "architecture" in result
    assert "components" in result["architecture"]
    assert len(result["architecture"]["components"]) >= 3

    # Validate content
    assert "inventory" in result["architecture"]["description"].lower()
    assert "microservice" in result["architecture"]["description"].lower()

    # Validate performance
    assert result["execution_time"] < 90.0  # seconds
    assert result["token_usage"]["total"] < 8000

def test_handles_missing_requirements(architect_agent):
    """Test agent handles incomplete input gracefully"""
    task = {
        "task": "Design something"  # Intentionally vague
    }

    result = architect_agent.execute(task)

    # Should request clarification
    assert result["status"] == "needs_clarification"
    assert "missing" in result["message"].lower()

def test_consistency_low_temperature(architect_agent):
    """Test output consistency with low temperature"""
    task = {
        "task": "Design REST API for user management with CRUD operations",
        "context": {"technology": "Python FastAPI"}
    }

    # Execute 3 times
    results = [architect_agent.execute(task) for _ in range(3)]

    # Endpoints should be consistent
    endpoints = [set(r["architecture"]["endpoints"]) for r in results]
    assert endpoints[0] == endpoints[1] == endpoints[2]
```

---

**2. Integration Testing**
Validate agent integration within workflows.

```python
def test_full_development_workflow():
    """Test complete workflow: Architect → Builder → Validator → Scribe"""
    workflow = Workflow("feature-development-pipeline")

    # Step 1: Architecture
    arch_result = workflow.execute_step(
        agent="architect-agent-prod",
        task="Design user authentication system with OAuth2"
    )
    assert arch_result["status"] == "completed"

    # Step 2: Implementation (uses architecture from step 1)
    build_result = workflow.execute_step(
        agent="builder-agent-prod",
        task="Implement authentication API",
        context={"architecture": arch_result["output"]["architecture"]}
    )
    assert build_result["status"] == "completed"
    assert "code" in build_result["output"]

    # Step 3: Validation
    valid_result = workflow.execute_step(
        agent="validator-agent-prod",
        task="Review implementation for security issues",
        context={"code": build_result["output"]["code"]}
    )
    assert valid_result["status"] == "completed"
    assert valid_result["output"]["approval"] == True

    # Step 4: Documentation
    doc_result = workflow.execute_step(
        agent="scribe-agent-prod",
        task="Generate API documentation",
        context={"code": build_result["output"]["code"]}
    )
    assert doc_result["status"] == "completed"
    assert "openapi" in doc_result["output"]
```

---

**3. Load Testing**
Ensure agents handle production load.

```python
import concurrent.futures

def test_concurrent_execution_load():
    """Test agent handles concurrent requests"""
    agent = Agent.load("builder-agent-prod")

    tasks = [
        {"task": f"Generate API endpoint for resource {i}"}
        for i in range(20)
    ]

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(agent.execute, task) for task in tasks]
        results = [f.result() for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]

**4. A/B Testing**
Compare different configurations.

```python
def test_model_comparison_quality():
    """Compare GPT-4 vs GPT-4-Turbo quality"""
    task = {
        "task": "Design authentication system with OAuth2, JWT, and MFA"
    }

    # Create two agent variants
    agent_gpt4 = Agent.load("architect-agent-gpt4")
    agent_gpt4_turbo = Agent.load("architect-agent-gpt4-turbo")

    # Execute with both
    result_gpt4 = agent_gpt4.execute(task)
    result_turbo = agent_gpt4_turbo.execute(task)

    # Compare quality (manual review or automated metrics)
    print(f"GPT-4 Cost: ${result_gpt4['cost']:.2f}, Time: {result_gpt4['execution_time']:.1f}s")
    print(f"GPT-4-Turbo Cost: ${result_turbo['cost']:.2f}, Time: {result_turbo['execution_time']:.1f}s")

    # Automated quality metrics (example)
    gpt4_score = calculate_quality_score(result_gpt4["output"])
    turbo_score = calculate_quality_score(result_turbo["output"])

    print(f"Quality Scores - GPT-4: {gpt4_score}, Turbo: {turbo_score}")

    # Decision: If turbo quality >= 90% of GPT-4 and cost < 50%, use turbo
    if turbo_score >= gpt4_score * 0.9 and result_turbo['cost'] < result_gpt4['cost'] * 0.5:
        print("Recommendation: Use GPT-4-Turbo")
```

### Optimization Guidelines

**1. Prompt Engineering**

**Clear Instructions:**
❌ Vague:
```
Create good architecture
```

✅ Specific:
```
Design a microservices architecture with:
1. Service boundaries clearly defined
2. Inter-service communication patterns (REST, gRPC, events)
3. Data storage strategy for each service
4. Scalability analysis for 1M requests/day
5. Mermaid C4 diagram

Output in this exact format: [specify format]
```

**Include Examples:**
```markdown
# System Prompt Example Section

## Input Example
{
  "task": "Design authentication service",
  "context": {
    "scale": "100K users",
    "auth_types": ["OAuth2", "JWT"]
  }
}

## Expected Output
```markdown
# Authentication Service Architecture

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary]

## Component Diagram
```mermaid
[diagram here]
```

## Components
### 1. Authorization Server
- **Technology**: IdentityServer4
- **Responsibility**: Issue JWT tokens...
```
```

**Remove Unnecessary Context:**
❌ Bloated:
```markdown
You are an exceptionally talented, world-class software architect with
decades of experience across every imaginable technology stack including
but not limited to Python, Java, C++, Go, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript...
[continues for 300 tokens]
```

✅ Focused:
```markdown
You are a cloud architect specializing in Azure microservices.
Focus: Scalable design, cost efficiency, security best practices.
```

**2. Model Selection**

**Decision Matrix:**

| Factor | GPT-3.5-Turbo | GPT-4-Turbo | GPT-4 |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Cost** | $0.002/1K tokens | $0.01/1K tokens | $0.03/1K tokens |
| **Speed** | Fast (1-3s) | Medium (3-7s) | Slow (5-15s) |
| **Quality** | Good | Very Good | Excellent |
| **Best For** | Simple tasks, high volume | Most production use | Critical quality |

**Use Case Recommendations:**

**GPT-3.5-Turbo:**
- Documentation generation
- Simple code snippets
- Boilerplate generation
- Development/testing environments
- High-volume batch processing

**GPT-4-Turbo (Recommended Default):**
- Architecture design
- Production code generation
- API implementation
- Security validation
- Most business-critical tasks

**GPT-4:**
- Complex system architecture
- Critical security reviews
- Mission-critical code
- Compliance validation
- When quality is paramount, cost secondary

---

**3. Caching Strategy**

Implement caching for deterministic responses:

```json
{
  "caching": {
    "enabled": true,
    "ttl": 3600,  // 1 hour
    "strategy": "semantic",  // Cache semantically similar queries
    "similarity_threshold": 0.95
  }
}
```

**What to Cache:**
- Deterministic tasks (low temperature)
- Common queries
- Documentation generation
- Standard patterns

**What NOT to Cache:**
- Creative tasks (high temperature)
- User-specific content
- Time-sensitive information
- Personalized outputs

---

**4. Monitoring and Alerts**

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**

```kusto
// Application Insights dashboard queries

// 1. Success Rate
customMetrics
| where name == "AgentExecution"
| extend agentId = tostring(customDimensions.agentId)
| extend success = tostring(customDimensions.success) == "true"
| summarize
    Total = count(),
    Successful = countif(success),
    SuccessRate = (countif(success) * 100.0) / count()
    by agentId, bin(timestamp, 1h)

// 2. Performance (P50, P95, P99)
customMetrics
| where name == "AgentExecutionTime"
| extend duration = toint(value)
| summarize
    P50 = percentile(duration, 50),
    P95 = percentile(duration, 95),
    P99 = percentile(duration, 99)
    by bin(timestamp, 1h)

// 3. Token Usage and Cost
customMetrics
| where name == "TokenUsage"
| extend tokens = toint(value)
| extend cost = tokens * 0.00003  // GPT-4-Turbo pricing
| summarize
    TotalTokens = sum(tokens),
    TotalCost = sum(cost),
    AvgTokensPerTask = avg(tokens)
    by bin(timestamp, 1d)

// 4. Error Rate by Type
traces
| where severityLevel >= 3  // Warning and above
| extend agentId = tostring(customDimensions.agentId)
| extend errorType = tostring(customDimensions.errorType)
| summarize Count = count() by errorType, agentId
| order by Count desc
```

**Alert Configuration:**

```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "name": "High Error Rate",
      "condition": "error_rate > 5%",
      "window": "5 minutes",
      "severity": "High",
      "action": "email + slack"
    },
    {
      "name": "Slow Performance",
      "condition": "p95_duration > 120 seconds",
      "window": "15 minutes",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "action": "email"
    },
    {
      "name": "Cost Spike",
      "condition": "hourly_cost > $50",
      "window": "1 hour",
      "severity": "High",
      "action": "email + slack"
    },
    {
      "name": "Rate Limit Errors",
      "condition": "rate_limit_errors > 10",
      "window": "5 minutes",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "action": "page + email + slack"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many agents should I create?**
A: Start with 4 (one of each type). Add specialized variants as needed. Most organizations use 10-20 agents across all environments.

**Q: Can I change an agent's type after creation?**
A: No. Agent type is immutable. Clone the agent and select a different type if needed.

**Q: How do I share agents across teams?**
A: Assign agent to a team, or leave unassigned for organization-wide access. Configure access control in agent settings.

**Q: What happens if I exceed Azure OpenAI quota?**
A: Tasks fail with rate limit errors (HTTP 429). Configure retry policies to handle gracefully. Request quota increase from Azure.

**Q: Can I use agents without Azure OpenAI?**
A: Currently, Agent Studio requires Azure OpenAI. OpenAI API and other providers not yet supported.

**Q: How do I version agents?**
A: Agent Studio uses semantic versioning. Major changes create new versions. View version history in agent details.

**Q: Are agent conversations stored?**
A: Yes, in Cosmos DB for 90 days (configurable). Use for debugging and audit trails.

**Q: Can agents call external APIs?**
A: Yes, configure in system prompt. Ensure proper authentication and error handling.

**Q: How do I test agents before production?**
A: Use the built-in test interface. Run representative tasks and validate outputs. Create staging environment for integration testing.

**Q: What's the cost per agent execution?**
A: Varies by model and task complexity. Typical range: $0.02-$0.15 per task. Monitor costs in analytics dashboard.
