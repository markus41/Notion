### Authentication & Access Issues

Issues related to login, permissions, and access control.

#### Issue: "Unauthorized" Error When Accessing Platform

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 401 error on login
- Redirected to login page repeatedly
- "Session expired" messages
- Can't access specific features

**Common Causes:**
1. Session timeout (default: 8 hours inactivity)
2. Cached credentials expired
3. Account disabled or suspended
4. Browser cookie issues
5. Recent password change

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Clear Session and Re-login**

1. Log out completely:
   - Click user menu → **"Logout"**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies for Agent Studio domain
   ```
   Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Time range: Last hour
   - ✓ Cookies and site data

   [Clear data]
   ```

2. Close all browser tabs with Agent Studio

3. Reopen browser and navigate to Agent Studio

4. Log in with credentials

**Expected Result:** Successful login, all features accessible

---

**Solution 2: Verify Account Status**

1. Try password reset:
   - Navigate to login page
   - Click **"Forgot Password?"**
   - Enter email address
   - Check email for reset link

2. If no reset email received:
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address spelling
   - Contact administrator to verify account status

3. Check account status:
   ```
   Administrator action:
   Navigate to: Admin → Users → [User Email]
   Status: Active ☐  Disabled ☐  Suspended ☐
   ```

---

**Solution 3: Browser-Specific Issues**

Try alternate browser:
- If using Chrome → Try Edge or Firefox
- If using Edge → Try Chrome
- If using Firefox → Try Chrome

**If works in alternate browser:**
- Issue is browser-specific
- Clear cache completely in original browser
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Check browser version (update if outdated)

---

**Solution 4: Network/VPN Issues**

1. Check network connectivity:
   ```bash
   # Ping Agent Studio domain
   ping agentstudio.yourdomain.com

   # Check if can resolve DNS
   nslookup agentstudio.yourdomain.com
   ```

2. If on VPN:
   - Try disconnecting VPN
   - If works without VPN → VPN configuration issue
   - Contact network admin to whitelist Agent Studio domain

3. Check firewall:
   - Corporate firewall may block authentication
   - Request IT to whitelist Agent Studio URLs

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Enable "Remember Me" on trusted devices (extends session)
□ Bookmark Agent Studio URL (avoid login redirects)
□ Set browser to not clear cookies on exit
□ Configure SSO if available (reduces password issues)
□ Keep browser updated to latest version
```

#### Issue: "Forbidden" Error When Executing Agents

**Symptoms:**
- Can access platform but can't execute tasks
- HTTP 403 errors on agent execution
- "Insufficient permissions" messages
- Some agents work, others don't

**Common Causes:**
1. Missing "Agent Executor" role
2. Agent assigned to different team
3. Agent in "Private" mode (owner-only access)
4. Environment restrictions
5. Recent role changes not yet propagated

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Verify User Roles**

1. Check your roles:
   ```
   Navigate to: Settings → User Profile → Roles

   Your Roles:
   ☐ Agent Viewer (can view agents)
   ☐ Agent Executor (can execute tasks)
   ☐ Agent Creator (can create agents)
   ☐ Agent Administrator (full access)
   ☐ Workflow Designer (can create workflows)
   ☐ Workflow Executor (can run workflows)
   ```

2. Required minimum for execution: **Agent Executor**

3. If missing role:
   ```
   Request from Team Lead:
   "Please grant me 'Agent Executor' role to execute agent tasks"

   Team Lead action:
   Navigate to: Admin → Users → [User] → Roles
   ✓ Agent Executor
   [Save Changes]
   ```

---

**Solution 2: Check Agent Ownership**

1. View agent details:
   ```
   Navigate to: Agents → [Agent Name] → Details

   Owner: [Owner Email]
   Team: [Team Name]
   Visibility:
     ○ Public (all users)
     ○ Team (team members only)
     ● Private (owner only)

   Access Control:
     Users with access: [List]
   ```

2. If agent is Private and you're not owner:
   ```
   Request from Agent Owner:
   "Please grant me access to [Agent Name] or change to Team visibility"

   Owner action:
   Navigate to: Agent → Settings → Access Control
   Add User: [Your Email]
   Permission: Execute
   [Save]

   Or change visibility:
   Visibility: ○ Private ● Team
   [Save]
   ```

---

**Solution 3: Environment Restrictions**

Some environments restrict agent execution:

```
Check environment policy:
Navigate to: Admin → Environments → [Environment]

Production Environment:
  Allowed Users: ● Specific users/roles
  Restricted to: [List of approved users]

If you're not in list:
  Request approval from Admin:
  "Please add me to Production environment approved users list"
```

---

**Solution 4: Recent Role Changes**

Role changes may take up to 5 minutes to propagate:

```
1. Check when role was granted: __________
2. Wait 5 minutes after role grant
3. Logout and login again
4. Try executing agent again
```

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Confirm required roles during onboarding
□ Use Team visibility for shared agents (not Private)
□ Document agent ownership and access control
□ Regular access review (quarterly)
□ Set up role request workflow for new users
```

### Agent Execution Issues

Problems occurring during agent task execution.

#### Issue: Agent Returns Incomplete or Truncated Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Response cuts off mid-sentence
- Missing expected sections
- Output feels incomplete
- "..." at end of response without conclusion

**Common Causes:**
1. `maxTokens` limit too low
2. Response naturally exceeds configured limit
3. Agent reaching Azure OpenAI model context window
4. Timeout occurring before completion

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. Check execution logs:
   ```
   Navigate to: Agent → Execution History → [Execution ID] → Logs

   Search for:
   "max_tokens reached" → Token limit hit
   "timeout exceeded" → Timeout before completion
   "context_length_exceeded" → Input too large
   ```

2. Review metrics:
   ```
   Token Usage:
     Input: _____ tokens
     Output: _____ tokens (check if equals maxTokens)
     Total: _____ tokens

   Execution Time:
     Duration: _____ seconds (check if near timeout)
     Timeout Setting: _____ seconds
   ```

---

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Increase maxTokens Limit**

Appropriate when: Output naturally needs more space

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Model Parameters

Current:
  maxTokens: 4000

Recommended adjustments:
  Simple responses: 2000-3000
  Standard responses: 4000-6000
  Complex/detailed: 6000-10000
  Very comprehensive: 10000-16000

Change to: [8000]

[Save Configuration]

Re-execute task
```

**Cost Impact:**
```
Current: 4000 tokens max @ $0.03/1K = $0.12 max
New: 8000 tokens max @ $0.03/1K = $0.24 max

Cost increase: $0.12 per execution
Monthly (100 executions): +$12
```

**Approve cost increase before applying.**

---

**Solution 2: Break Task into Smaller Subtasks**

Appropriate when: Task is inherently too large for single execution

**Instead of:**
```
Task: "Design complete e-commerce platform with user management,
       product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment integration,
       order management, inventory system, reporting, and admin panel"

Expected: Complete architecture (would need 50K+ tokens)
```

**Use workflow with steps:**
```
Workflow: "E-Commerce Platform Architecture"

Step 1: "Design user management and authentication architecture"
  Scope: Auth, profiles, roles, permissions
  Expected tokens: ~5000

Step 2: "Design product catalog and search architecture"
  Scope: Products, categories, search, filtering
  Expected tokens: ~5000

Step 3: "Design shopping cart and checkout architecture"
  Scope: Cart, checkout flow, address management
  Expected tokens: ~5000

Step 4: "Design payment and order processing architecture"
  Scope: Payment integration, order lifecycle, fulfillment
  Expected tokens: ~5000

Step 5: "Design inventory and reporting architecture"
  Scope: Inventory tracking, analytics, admin dashboard
  Expected tokens: ~5000

Total: ~25000 tokens across 5 focused tasks
```

**Benefits:**
- Each output is complete and comprehensive
- More manageable and reviewable
- Can iterate on individual sections
- Parallel execution possible
- Lower risk of incomplete outputs

---

**Solution 3: Request Structured Summary**

Appropriate when: Need comprehensive coverage in limited tokens

**Update system prompt:**
```markdown
# Output Format

Provide concise, structured responses using this format:

## Executive Summary (max 200 words)
[High-level overview]

## Key Components (bullet list)
- [Component 1]: [Brief description]
- [Component 2]: [Brief description]
- [Component 3]: [Brief description]

## Architecture Diagram (Mermaid)
[Concise diagram focusing on key relationships]

## Critical Decisions
1. [Decision]: [Brief rationale]
2. [Decision]: [Brief rationale]

## Next Steps (numbered list)
1. [Action item]
2. [Action item]

## Detailed Design (if tokens allow)
[Comprehensive details]

Prioritize completeness of earlier sections. If approaching token limit,
stop after "Next Steps" and note: "Detailed design available on request."
```

This ensures critical information always included even if truncated.

---

**Solution 4: Increase Timeout**

If truncation due to timeout, not token limit:

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Execution Settings

Current:
  taskTimeoutSeconds: 120

Check execution logs for timeout warnings:
  [Warning] Execution time: 118s (near timeout)

Increase to: [240] seconds

[Save Configuration]

Note: Longer timeout allows more token generation time.
      Typical: GPT-4 generates ~30 tokens/second
      For 8000 tokens output: ~270 seconds needed
```

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Set maxTokens based on expected output length
  - Review historical token usage
  - Add 25% buffer for variation

□ Test agents with representative complex tasks
  - Verify outputs are complete
  - Check token usage patterns

□ Use structured output formats
  - Ensures priority information included first
  - Graceful degradation if truncated

□ Monitor execution metrics
  - Alert if tokens consistently hit maxTokens
  - Alert if execution time near timeout

□ Document expected output sizes in agent description
  - "Typical output: 3000-5000 tokens"
  - Helps users set appropriate expectations
```

---

#### Issue: Agent Behavior is Inconsistent

**Symptoms:**
- Same input produces different outputs
- Quality varies between executions
- Can't reproduce specific results
- Unpredictable agent behavior

**Common Causes:**
1. High `temperature` setting introducing randomness
2. Vague or ambiguous system prompt
3. Insufficient context in task description
4. Non-deterministic agent design
5. Different Azure OpenAI model versions

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Measure consistency:**
   ```
   Test Procedure:
   1. Execute same task 3 times
   2. Compare outputs side-by-side
   3. Measure similarity

   Results:
   Execution 1: [Key outputs]
   Execution 2: [Key outputs]
   Execution 3: [Key outputs]

   Similarity: High (>90%) ☐  Medium (70-90%) ☐  Low (<70%) ☐
   ```

2. **Check temperature setting:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Model Parameters

   Temperature: _______

   0.0-0.3: Deterministic (expected high consistency)
   0.4-0.7: Balanced (moderate variation normal)
   0.8-1.0: Creative (high variation expected)
   1.1-2.0: Highly creative (very high variation expected)
   ```

3. **Review system prompt specificity:**
   ```
   System Prompt Clarity Check:

   ☐ Role clearly defined?
   ☐ Specific output format specified?
   ☐ Examples provided?
   ☐ Constraints explicit?
   ☐ Terminology consistent?

   Specificity Score: ___/5
   ```

---

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Reduce Temperature for Consistency**

Appropriate when: Need deterministic, repeatable outputs

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Model Parameters

Current Temperature: 0.7

Recommended for consistency:
  Code generation: 0.2
  Technical documentation: 0.3
  Architecture (single solution): 0.4

Change to: [0.3]

[Save Configuration]

Test: Execute same task 3 times
Expected: High similarity (>95%)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ More consistent outputs
- ✅ Reproducible results
- ❌ Less creative/varied solutions
- ❌ May feel "mechanical"

**When to keep higher temperature:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Multiple solution options needed
- Creative exploration
- Ideation tasks

---

**Solution 2: Improve System Prompt Specificity**

Appropriate when: Prompt is vague or ambiguous

**Current (Vague) Prompt:**
```markdown
You are helpful and knowledgeable. Create good solutions.
```

**Improved (Specific) Prompt:**
```markdown
# Role
You are a senior cloud architect specializing in Azure microservices.

# Mission
Design scalable, cost-effective architectures following Azure Well-Architected Framework.

# Core Capabilities
- Break down requirements into microservice components
- Design using specific Azure services (App Service, Functions, Service Bus, Cosmos DB)
- Provide architecture diagrams using Mermaid C4 notation
- Calculate cost estimates using Azure Pricing Calculator assumptions

# Constraints
You must NOT:
- Recommend services without cost justification
- Design without considering scalability to 1M+ users
- Skip security considerations (always address AuthN/AuthZ)
- Use vague terms like "database" (specify: Cosmos DB, SQL Database, etc.)

Always:
- Specify exact Azure service SKUs (e.g., "App Service P2v3" not "App Service")
- Include specific metrics (RPS, storage size, concurrent users)
- Provide alternatives with tradeoffs

# Output Format
## 1. Executive Summary (3 sentences max)
[Brief overview]

## 2. Architecture Diagram
```mermaid
C4Context
[Specific C4 diagram with Azure services]
```

## 3. Component Details
For each component:
- **Service**: [Exact Azure service and SKU]
- **Purpose**: [What it does]
- **Scaling**: [How it scales to target load]
- **Cost**: [Monthly cost estimate]

## 4. Key Decisions
[3-5 major decisions with rationale]

# Example
Input: "Design user authentication"
Output:
[Complete example following format exactly]
```

**After updating:**
1. Save configuration
2. Test with same inputs 3 times
3. Verify consistency improved

---

**Solution 3: Add Context to Tasks**

Appropriate when: Tasks lack necessary detail

**Minimal Context (Inconsistent Results):**
```json
{
  "task": "Design notification system"
}

Why inconsistent:
- Agent guesses scale (100 users? 1M users?)
- Agent guesses technology (Azure? AWS? On-prem?)
- Agent guesses requirements (real-time? batch? email?)
```

**Rich Context (Consistent Results):**
```json
{
  "task": "Design real-time notification system",
  "context": {
    "scale": {
      "concurrentUsers": 100000,
      "messagesPerSecond": 5000,
      "peakMultiplier": 3
    },
    "requirements": {
      "delivery": "real-time push (<1s latency)",
      "reliability": "guaranteed delivery with persistence",
      "ordering": "per-user message ordering required"
    },
    "technology": {
      "cloud": "Azure",
      "existing": ["Azure App Service", "Cosmos DB", "Redis"],
      "preferences": ["managed services", "serverless where possible"]
    },
    "constraints": {
      "budget": "$3000/month maximum",
      "timeline": "MVP in 3 weeks",
      "team": "2 backend developers, 1 DevOps"
    }
  }
}

Why consistent:
- All assumptions explicitly stated
- Agent has complete context
- No guessing required
- Deterministic inputs → Deterministic outputs
```

---

**Solution 4: Pin Model Version**

Azure OpenAI sometimes updates model versions, causing variation:

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Azure OpenAI

Current:
  Deployment Name: gpt-4-turbo
  API Version: 2024-02-15-preview
  Model Version: [Latest] ← This can change

Recommended for consistency:
  Model Version: [Specific version, e.g., "turbo-2024-04-09"]

Note: Pinning version prevents automatic improvements but ensures consistency.
Use for: Critical production agents requiring exact reproducibility
```

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Set temperature based on use case
  - Deterministic tasks: 0.2-0.4
  - Balanced: 0.5-0.7
  - Creative: 0.8-1.0

□ Test consistency during agent creation
  - Execute same task 5 times
  - Measure variation
  - Adjust temperature if needed

□ Provide comprehensive system prompts
  - Clear output format
  - Specific terminology
  - Concrete examples

□ Require rich context in tasks
  - Create task templates with context fields
  - Validate context completeness before execution

□ Document expected consistency level
  - "Deterministic agent - consistent outputs expected"
  - "Creative agent - variation is normal"

□ Monitor consistency metrics
  - Track output similarity over time
  - Alert if consistency degrades
```

---

#### Issue: Agent Takes Too Long to Respond

**Symptoms:**
- Execution time exceeds expectations
- Frequent timeout errors
- Users complaining about slow response
- Agent shows "Running" for extended period

**Common Causes:**
1. `maxTokens` set too high (more tokens = more time)
2. Complex task requiring extensive reasoning
3. Model selection (GPT-4 slower than GPT-3.5-Turbo)
4. Azure OpenAI service throttling/latency
5. Network connectivity issues

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check execution metrics:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Agent → Execution History → [Slow Execution]

   Execution Time: _____ seconds
   Token Usage: _____ tokens
   Model: _____

   Compare to agent average:
   Agent Average: _____ seconds
   This execution: _____ seconds
   Difference: _____ seconds (___%)
   ```

2. **Analyze time breakdown:**
   ```
   From detailed logs:

   [00:00:00] Task received
   [00:00:02] Sending to Azure OpenAI
   [00:00:05] First token received  ← Request latency: 3s
   [00:02:35] Response complete     ← Generation time: 150s
   [00:02:37] Post-processing
   [00:02:38] Complete

   Total: 158 seconds

   Identify bottleneck:
   Request latency: 3s (normal: <5s)
   Generation time: 150s (check if excessive for token count)
   Post-processing: 1s (normal: <3s)
   ```

3. **Check Azure OpenAI health:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Settings → Integrations → Azure OpenAI → Health

   Status: Healthy ☐  Degraded ☐  Outage ☐
   Average Latency: _____ ms (normal: <1000ms)
   Error Rate: _____ % (normal: <1%)

   If degraded/outage: Wait for Azure to resolve
   ```

---

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Optimize maxTokens**

Appropriate when: maxTokens is unnecessarily high

```
Analysis:
  maxTokens configured: 8000
  Actual tokens used: 2100 (26%)
  Generation time: 150 seconds

Calculation:
  GPT-4 Turbo generates ~30 tokens/second
  For 2100 tokens: ~70 seconds expected
  Overhead: ~80 seconds wasted generating capacity

Recommendation:
  Reduce maxTokens to match actual usage + buffer
  Target: 3000 tokens (2100 actual + 40% buffer)
```

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Model Parameters

Change:
  maxTokens: 8000 → 3000

Expected improvement:
  Generation time: 150s → 75s (50% faster)
  Cost: 30% reduction (paying for fewer unused tokens)

[Save Configuration]
```

---

**Solution 2: Use Faster Model**

Appropriate when: Task doesn't require GPT-4's advanced reasoning

**Model Performance Comparison:**

| Model | Speed | Quality | Cost | Best For |
|-------|-------|---------|------|----------|
| GPT-3.5-Turbo | 5-10x faster | Good | 1/10 cost | Simple tasks, documentation |
| GPT-4-Turbo | 2-3x faster | Very good | 1/3 cost | Most production tasks |
| GPT-4 | Baseline | Excellent | Baseline | Complex reasoning, critical quality |

```
Current agent model: GPT-4
Task complexity: Medium (code generation, standard patterns)

Recommendation: Switch to GPT-4-Turbo

Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Azure OpenAI
  Deployment Name: gpt-4 → gpt-4-turbo

Expected improvement:
  Speed: 2-3x faster (150s → 50-75s)
  Cost: 67% reduction
  Quality: Minimal impact for most tasks

[Save Configuration]
```

**When NOT to switch:**
- Critical architecture requiring deep reasoning
- Security validation (accuracy paramount)
- Complex problem-solving
- When quality is more important than speed

---

**Solution 3: Increase Timeout**

Appropriate when: Task legitimately requires more time

```
Current situation:
  Task: "Design complete microservices architecture for enterprise system"
  Complexity: Very high
  Expected output: 8000 tokens (comprehensive)
  Current timeout: 120 seconds
  Generation time needed: ~270 seconds (8000 tokens ÷ 30 tokens/s)

Analysis: Timeout too short for task complexity
```

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Execution Settings

Change:
  taskTimeoutSeconds: 120 → 300 (5 minutes)

Recommendation:
  Simple tasks: 60-120s
  Medium tasks: 120-240s
  Complex tasks: 240-480s
  Very complex: 480-600s

[Save Configuration]
```

**Balance:** Higher timeout = longer potential waits if agent hangs

---

**Solution 4: Optimize Task Complexity**

Appropriate when: Single task is too ambitious

**Current approach:**
```
Single task: "Design, implement, test, and document user authentication system"
Expected time: Very long (multiple steps combined)
```

**Optimized approach (workflow):**
```
Workflow: "Authentication System Development"

Step 1: Design (Architect) - 60s
Step 2: Implement (Builder) - 120s
Step 3: Test (Validator) - 90s
Step 4: Document (Scribe) - 80s

Total: 350s sequential
Or: 120s parallel (if steps 2-4 can run concurrently)

Benefits:
- Each step completes quickly
- Better user experience (incremental progress)
- Can cache/reuse step outputs
- Easier to recover from failures
```

---

**Solution 5: Check Network/Service Issues**

If problem is environmental:

```
1. Check Azure OpenAI service health:
   https://status.azure.com/status
   Region: [Your region]
   Service: Cognitive Services

2. Test connectivity:
   bash
   # Test latency to Azure OpenAI
   curl -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n" \
     -X POST "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/..." \
     -H "api-key: key" \
     -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}],"max_tokens":10}'

   Expected: <1 second
   If >3 seconds: Network/service latency issue

3. Check from different network:
   - Try from home vs office
   - Try with/without VPN
   - If faster without VPN: VPN routing issue

4. Contact Azure support if persistent service latency
```

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Right-size maxTokens
  - Review historical token usage
  - Set to p95 + 25% buffer
  - Don't over-allocate "just in case"

□ Use appropriate models
  - GPT-3.5-Turbo: Simple, high-volume tasks
  - GPT-4-Turbo: Default for most tasks

### Rate Limit & Quota Issues

Problems related to Azure OpenAI rate limiting and quota management.

#### Issue: "Rate Limit Exceeded" (HTTP 429) Errors

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 429 error responses
- "Rate limit exceeded" messages
- Tasks queued or failing
- Increased retry attempts
- Service degradation during peak usage

**Understanding Rate Limits:**

Azure OpenAI enforces two types of limits:

1. **Tokens Per Minute (TPM)**: Total tokens (input + output) per minute
2. **Requests Per Minute (RPM)**: Number of API calls per minute

**Example quotas by SKU:**

| Model | Standard TPM | Standard RPM | Enterprise TPM | Enterprise RPM |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| GPT-4 | 10,000 | 60 | 300,000 | 1,800 |
| GPT-4-Turbo | 30,000 | 180 | 450,000 | 2,700 |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo | 60,000 | 360 | 1,000,000 | 6,000 |

---

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check current quota:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Dashboard → Usage → Azure OpenAI Quotas

   GPT-4-Turbo Deployment:
     TPM Limit: 30,000
     Current TPM Usage: 28,500 (95%) ← High utilization!
     RPM Limit: 180
     Current RPM Usage: 45 (25%)

   Analysis: Approaching TPM limit, RPM okay
   ```

2. **Review recent usage patterns:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Dashboard → Analytics → Rate Limit Events

   Last Hour:
     429 Errors: 45
     Peak Time: 14:30-14:35 (30 errors)
     Affected Agents: [List]

   Usage Pattern:
     Normal usage: 15K TPM average
     Spike: 35K TPM (exceeded limit)
     Cause: Multiple concurrent workflows launched
   ```

3. **Identify high-usage agents:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Analytics → Token Usage by Agent

   | Agent | Executions | Avg Tokens | Total TPM |
   |-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | architect-prod | 25 | 6,500 | 16,250 |
   | builder-prod | 18 | 4,200 | 7,560 |
   | scribe-prod | 12 | 3,800 | 4,560 |

   Total: 28,370 TPM (95% of 30K limit)
   ```

---

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Implement Request Queuing**

Appropriate when: Bursty traffic patterns causing temporary spikes

```
Enable built-in queue to smooth request distribution:

Navigate to: Settings → Execution → Request Queue

Configuration:
  [✓] Enable Request Queue
  Max Queue Size: [100] requests
  Queue Timeout: [300] seconds
  Priority Handling: [✓] Enabled

Priority Levels:
  Critical: Execute immediately (skip queue if needed)
  High: Front of queue
  Normal: Standard queue position
  Low: Back of queue (may delay during high load)

Queue Strategy:
  ○ First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
  ● Token-Aware (optimize for quota utilization)

[Save Configuration]
```

**How it works:**
```
Without queue:
  30 requests arrive simultaneously
  → All sent to Azure OpenAI
  → Quota exceeded
  → 15+ requests fail with 429

With queue:
  30 requests arrive simultaneously
  → 10 execute immediately (within quota)
  → 20 queued
  → Executes queued requests as quota available
  → All succeed (may take longer)
```

---

**Solution 2: Distribute Load Across Multiple Deployments**

Appropriate when: Sustained high usage exceeding single deployment quota

```
Create multiple Azure OpenAI deployments for load distribution:

Azure Setup:
  Deployment 1: gpt-4-turbo-primary (30K TPM)
  Deployment 2: gpt-4-turbo-secondary (30K TPM)
  Total capacity: 60K TPM
```

```
Configure Agent Studio for multi-deployment:

Navigate to: Settings → Azure OpenAI → Deployments

[+ Add Deployment]
  Name: gpt-4-turbo-secondary
  Endpoint: https://resource2.openai.azure.com/
  API Key: [From Key Vault]
  TPM Quota: 30000
  RPM Quota: 180

Load Balancing Strategy:
  ● Round-robin (distribute evenly)
  ○ Least-utilized (send to deployment with most quota available)
  ○ Priority-based (primary first, fallback to secondary)

[Save Configuration]
```

**Expected result:**
```
Before: 30K TPM limit → 95% utilization → frequent 429s
After: 60K TPM limit → 47% utilization → rare 429s
```

**Cost impact:** 2x Azure OpenAI resource cost

---

**Solution 3: Optimize Token Usage**

Appropriate when: High token consumption per task

**Token Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Reduce System Prompt Size:**
   ```
   Current system prompt: 850 tokens
   Every execution pays: 850 input tokens

   Optimization:
   - Remove redundant explanations
   - Condense examples
   - Remove verbose context

   Optimized system prompt: 420 tokens
   Savings: 430 tokens per execution

   Impact (1000 executions/day):
   - Daily token savings: 430,000 tokens
   - Monthly: 12.9M tokens
   - TPM reduction: ~9,000 TPM (30% less)
   ```

2. **Reduce maxTokens:**
   ```
   Review actual token usage:

   Agent: builder-agent-prod
   maxTokens: 8000
   Actual p95 usage: 4,200 tokens
   Waste: 3,800 tokens capacity (47%)

   Optimization:
   maxTokens: 8000 → 5000

   Impact:
   - Faster execution (less generation time)
   - Lower TPM consumption
   - 30% cost reduction
   ```

3. **Cache Common Responses:**
   ```
   Enable semantic caching for repetitive tasks:

   Navigate to: Settings → Caching

   [✓] Enable Semantic Caching
   TTL: [3600] seconds (1 hour)
   Similarity Threshold: [0.95] (95% similar = cache hit)

   Impact for repetitive tasks:
   - 60-80% cache hit rate
   - 60-80% TPM reduction for cached queries
   - Near-instant responses from cache
   ```

---

**Solution 4: Request Quota Increase from Azure**

Appropriate when: Legitimate sustained high usage

```
Submit quota increase request:

Azure Portal → Cognitive Services → [Your Resource] → Quotas

Current Quota:
  GPT-4-Turbo: 30,000 TPM

Requested Quota:
  GPT-4-Turbo: 100,000 TPM

Justification:
  "Our Agent Studio platform processes 2,000 agent tasks daily
   with average 5,000 tokens per task = 10M tokens daily = 6,900 TPM average.

   Current 30K TPM quota causes rate limiting during peak hours (8am-10am, 2pm-4pm)
   with 15% of requests receiving 429 errors.

   Requested 100K TPM would provide 3.5x buffer for peak traffic and growth."

Business Impact:
  - User productivity blocked during rate limits
  - Workflows failing mid-execution
  - Development team morale affected

[Submit Request]

Expected Response Time: 2-5 business days
```

---

**Solution 5: Implement Rate Limit-Aware Retry Logic**

Already configured in Agent Studio, but can optimize:

```
Navigate to: Agent → Configuration → Retry Policy

Current:
  maxRetries: 3
  initialDelayMs: 1000
  exponentialBackoff: true

Optimization for rate limits:
  maxRetries: 5 (more retries for transient 429s)
  initialDelayMs: 5000 (longer initial wait for quota refresh)
  exponentialBackoff: true
  maxDelayMs: 60000 (max 1 minute between retries)
  retryOnStatusCodes: [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]

[Save Configuration]
```

**Retry behavior:**
```
Retry 1: Wait 5s
Retry 2: Wait 10s (exponential backoff)
Retry 3: Wait 20s
Retry 4: Wait 40s
Retry 5: Wait 60s (capped at maxDelayMs)

Total: Up to 135 seconds of retry attempts
```

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Monitor quota utilization
  - Set alert at 70% utilization
  - Review usage patterns daily
  - Forecast growth and plan capacity

□ Right-size agent configurations
  - Audit token usage monthly
  - Optimize high-usage agents
  - Remove token waste

□ Implement request queuing
  - Smooth traffic spikes
  - Prioritize critical requests

□ Distribute load geographically
  - Multiple regions if global users
  - Separate dev/staging/prod deployments

□ Schedule batch operations
  - Run during off-peak hours
  - Avoid peak traffic times (8-10am, 2-4pm)

□ Cache aggressively
  - Enable semantic caching
  - Cache repetitive queries
  - Monitor cache hit rate

□ Plan for growth
  - Request quota increases proactively
  - Don't wait for rate limiting to occur
```

### Workflow Execution Issues

Problems during multi-agent workflow execution.

#### Issue: Workflow Stuck on Specific Step

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow shows "Running" for extended time
- Specific step never completes
- No progress for >30 minutes
- Agent thoughts stream frozen

**Common Causes:**
1. Agent execution hung/timeout
2. Dependency deadlock
3. Azure OpenAI service issue
4. Network connectivity problem
5. Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Identify stuck step:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Workflows → Execution → [Workflow ID]

   Step Status:
   ✅ Step 1: Complete (87s)
   ✅ Step 2: Complete (104s)
   ⏳ Step 3: Running (1,847s) ← Stuck here!
   ⏸️ Step 4: Pending

   Step 3 Details:
   Agent: validator-agent-prod
   Task: "Validate implementation..."
   Started: 2025-10-09 14:30:00
   Last Activity: 2025-10-09 14:32:15 ← No activity for 28+ minutes
   ```

2. **Check agent logs:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Workflows → Execution → Step 3 → Logs

   [14:30:05] INFO: Step 3 started
   [14:30:08] INFO: Sending request to validator-agent-prod
   [14:30:12] INFO: Agent thoughts streaming started
   [14:32:15] DEBUG: Agent thoughts: "Analyzing security vulnerabilities..."
   [14:32:15] DEBUG: No further log entries ← Activity stopped here

   Diagnosis: Agent execution hung at Azure OpenAI level
   ```

3. **Check Azure OpenAI health:**
   ```
   Navigate to: Settings → Azure OpenAI → Health

   Status: ● Healthy
   Recent Requests:
     14:32:10 - Success (200)
     14:32:15 - Success (200) ← Last successful request
     [No requests after 14:32:15]

   Diagnosis: Agent submitted request but never received response
   ```

---

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Cancel and Retry Step**

Immediate action to unstuck workflow:

```
Navigate to: Workflows → Execution → [Workflow ID]

Step 3: validator-agent-prod (Running 1,847s)

Actions:
  [Cancel Step] - Stop current execution, retry from beginning
  [Skip Step] - Skip this step, continue workflow (not recommended)
  [Force Complete] - Mark as complete with partial results (risky)

Recommended: [Cancel Step]

Confirmation:
  "Cancel Step 3 and retry?
   Current progress will be lost.
   Step will restart from beginning."

  [Yes, Cancel and Retry] [No, Wait Longer]

After cancel:
  Status: ⏳ Step 3 restarting...
  [Monitor new attempt]
```

---

**Solution 2: Resume from Checkpoint**

If workflow has checkpoints enabled:

```
Navigate to: Workflows → Execution → [Workflow ID] → Checkpoints

Available Checkpoints:
  ✓ Checkpoint 1: After Step 1 (saved: 14:28:30)
  ✓ Checkpoint 2: After Step 2 (saved: 14:30:14)
  ✗ Checkpoint 3: After Step 3 (not reached)

Actions:
  [Resume from Checkpoint 2]
    - Restores state after Step 2
    - Retries Step 3 with fresh execution
    - Preserves all Step 1-2 outputs

Confirmation:
  "Resume workflow from Checkpoint 2?
   - Step 3 will be retried
   - Steps 1-2 will not be re-executed
   - All previous outputs preserved"

  [Yes, Resume] [Cancel]
```

---

**Solution 3: Increase Step Timeout**

If step legitimately needs more time:

```
Navigate to: Workflows → [Workflow Name] → Design → Step 3

Current Configuration:
  Timeout: 180 seconds (3 minutes)

Analysis:
  Task Complexity: Very high (comprehensive security validation)
  Expected Tokens: 8000
  Expected Time: ~300 seconds

Recommendation: Increase timeout

Change to:
  Timeout: 480 seconds (8 minutes)

[Save Workflow]

Note: This applies to future executions.
      Current stuck execution still needs cancellation.
```

---

**Solution 4: Check for Dependency Deadlock**

In parallel workflows, check for circular dependencies:

```
Workflow: parallel-build-workflow

Step 2a: Builder (API) → Depends on: Step 1 ✓
Step 2b: Builder (UI) → Depends on: Step 1 ✓, Step 2a (API artifacts) ✓
Step 2c: Builder (DB) → Depends on: Step 1 ✓, Step 2b (UI config) ✓

Deadlock Detected:
  Step 2b waits for Step 2a
  Step 2c waits for Step 2b
  Step 2a not completing → 2b can't start → 2c can't start

Resolution:
  1. Fix dependency chain (2c shouldn't depend on 2b)
  2. Or make sequential (2a → 2b → 2c)
```

```
Navigate to: Workflows → Design → Dependencies

Fix dependency:
  Step 2c: Builder (DB)
    Remove Dependency: Step 2b (UI) ← Not actually needed
    Keep Dependency: Step 1 only

[Save Workflow]
[Cancel Current Execution]
[Re-execute with Fixed Dependencies]
```

---

**Solution 5: Manual Intervention**

For critical workflows, manually complete step:

```
Navigate to: Workflows → Execution → Step 3

[Manual Intervention]

Options:
  1. Provide Results Manually
     - Upload validation report manually
     - Mark step as complete
     - Continue workflow

  2. Partial Complete
     - Save partial results from agent
     - Mark as "Partial Success"
     - Continue with warning

  3. Skip with Justification
     - Skip step entirely
     - Provide reason (e.g., "Manual validation performed offline")
     - Continue workflow

Recommended for emergencies only.
```

---

**Preventive Measures:**

```
□ Enable checkpointing
  - Checkpoint after each step
  - Enable automatic recovery
  - Retain checkpoints for 7 days

□ Set realistic timeouts
  - Based on task complexity
  - Add 25% buffer for variation
  - Monitor timeout frequency

□ Monitor workflow health
  - Alert if step running >2x expected time
  - Automated cancellation after 3x timeout
  - Notify workflow owner

□ Test workflows thoroughly
  - Dry run before production use
  - Test with realistic data
  - Verify all steps complete

□ Design for failure
  - Avoid circular dependencies
  - Make steps idempotent (safe to retry)
  - Include rollback mechanisms

□ Document recovery procedures
  - Team runbook for stuck workflows
  - Escalation path clear
  - On-call rotation defined
```
