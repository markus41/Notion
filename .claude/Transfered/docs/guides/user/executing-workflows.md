# Executing Agent Tasks and Workflows

**Best for:** Organizations establishing reliable operational processes that streamline task execution, improve workflow visibility, and drive consistent, measurable results across business operations.

This comprehensive guide establishes clear execution pathways for both single-agent tasks and complex multi-agent workflows, designed to reduce execution errors by 50% and improve operational efficiency across teams.

## Overview

### Understanding Agent Task Execution

Agent Studio provides two primary execution modes:

**1. Single-Agent Task Execution**
- Direct task execution with one agent
- Immediate results for specific needs
- Ideal for ad-hoc requests and simple operations
- Quick feedback loop (30 seconds to 5 minutes)

**2. Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration**
- Coordinated execution across multiple agents
- Complex operations broken into logical steps
- Built-in error handling and recovery
- Production-grade reliability and observability

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Single-Agent Tasks When:**
- One-off requests requiring immediate results
- Simple operations within single domain
- Testing agent capabilities
- Quick prototyping or exploration
- No dependencies on other tasks

**Example Single-Agent Tasks:**
```
✓ "Generate API documentation for user endpoint"
✓ "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
✓ "Design database schema for inventory management"
✓ "Implement password reset API endpoint"
```

**Use Multi-Agent Workflows When:**
- Multiple steps required to complete objective
- Tasks have dependencies (output of one feeds next)
- Quality gates and validation needed
- Consistent, repeatable processes
- Production-grade reliability required

**Example Workflows:**
```
✓ Feature Development: Architect → Builder → Validator → Scribe
✓ Code Review Pipeline: Validator → Builder (fixes) → Validator (re-review)
✓ Architecture Evolution: Architect → Validator → Architect (refine) → Scribe
✓ Security Audit: Validator (scan) → Builder (fix) → Validator (verify) → Scribe (report)
```

### Target Audience

**End Users:** Execute tasks and monitor results
**Operators:** Manage workflow execution and troubleshoot issues
**Team Leads:** Design workflows and optimize processes

---

## Single-Agent Task Execution

Execute individual tasks directly from the Agent Studio interface or via API.

### Step 1: Select an Agent

Navigate to the agent you want to use:

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Log in to Agent Studio
2. Click **"Agents"** in left sidebar
3. Browse available agents or use search
4. View agent details:
   - Agent type and description
   - Recent performance metrics
   - Example use cases
   - Team ownership

**Search and Filter:**
```
Search: "payment" → Shows payment-related agents
Filter by:
- Agent Type: Architect, Builder, Validator, Scribe
- Team: Your team, shared, all
- Environment: Development, Staging, Production
- Status: Active, Deprecated
```

**Agent Selection Tips:**

**For Architecture Tasks:**
- Use Architect agents
- Check agent description matches your domain (e.g., "microservices", "data architecture")
- Verify agent uses appropriate model (GPT-4 recommended for complex architecture)

**For Code Generation:**
- Use Builder agents
- Match technology stack (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
- Check if agent specializes in your framework (FastAPI, React, etc.)

**For Quality Assurance:**
- Use Validator agents
- Confirm agent covers your validation type (security, performance, etc.)
- Verify agent provides actionable feedback

**For Documentation:**
- Use Scribe agents
- Check output format capability (OpenAPI, Markdown, etc.)
- Ensure agent understands your target audience

## Multi-Agent Workflows

Orchestrate multiple agents to accomplish complex objectives.

### Understanding Workflow Patterns

Agent Studio supports four primary workflow patterns:

#### 1. Sequential Workflows

**Description:**
Tasks execute one after another in defined order. Each task receives output from previous task.

**Visualization:**
```
Step 1: Architect → Step 2: Builder → Step 3: Validator → Step 4: Scribe
```

**Best For:**
- Linear processes with clear dependencies
- Each step builds on previous step's output
- Waterfall-style development
- Predictable, repeatable processes

**Example Use Case: Feature Development**
```yaml
Workflow: "Payment Integration Feature"
Pattern: Sequential

Step 1: Architect Agent
  Task: "Design Stripe payment integration architecture"
  Output: architecture, components, API contracts

Step 2: Builder Agent
  Task: "Implement payment API based on architecture"
  Input: architecture from Step 1
  Output: source code, tests

Step 3: Validator Agent
  Task: "Security review of payment implementation"
  Input: code from Step 2
  Output: security report, issues

Step 4: Scribe Agent
  Task: "Generate API documentation"
  Input: code from Step 2
  Output: OpenAPI spec, integration guide
```

**Benefits:**
- Simple to understand and debug
- Clear audit trail
- Easy to add checkpoints
- Natural error isolation

**When Not to Use:**
- Independent tasks that can run in parallel
- Tasks with no dependencies
- Need for maximum speed

---

#### 2. Parallel Workflows

**Description:**
Tasks execute simultaneously, with optional dependency management.

**Visualization:**
```
                    ┌─→ Task A (Builder: API)
                    │
Start ──────────────┼─→ Task B (Builder: UI)  ───→ Merge ──→ Task D (Validator)
                    │
                    └─→ Task C (Builder: DB)
```

**Best For:**
- Independent tasks with no dependencies
- Maximizing execution speed
- Resource-intensive operations
- Tasks that can safely run concurrently

**Example Use Case: Multi-Component Development**
```yaml
Workflow: "Full-Stack Feature Development"
Pattern: Parallel (with merge step)

Parallel Phase:
  Step 1a: Builder Agent (Backend)
    Task: "Implement REST API endpoints"

  Step 1b: Builder Agent (Frontend)
    Task: "Implement React UI components"

  Step 1c: Builder Agent (Database)
    Task: "Create database migration scripts"

Merge Step:
  Wait for: All parallel steps complete

Step 2: Validator Agent
  Task: "Integration testing across all components"
  Input: Outputs from 1a, 1b, 1c

Step 3: Scribe Agent
  Task: "Generate comprehensive documentation"
  Input: All component implementations
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast execution (parallel processing)
- Efficient resource utilization
- Independent error handling per branch
- Scales well with more tasks

**When Not to Use:**
- Tasks have strict dependencies
- Output of one feeds input of another
- Shared resources (risk of conflicts)
- Sequential approval gates required

---

#### 3. Iterative Workflows

**Description:**
Task repeats until validation passes or max iterations reached. Validator provides feedback for improvement.

**Visualization:**
```
Start → Architect → Validator → Pass? → Yes → Complete
                        ↓
                        No (feedback)
                        ↓
                      Architect (refine) → [loop back to Validator]
```

**Best For:**
- Quality-driven outputs
- Refinement based on feedback
- Continuous improvement
- Meeting strict acceptance criteria

**Example Use Case: Architecture Refinement**
```yaml
Workflow: "Production-Ready Architecture Design"
Pattern: Iterative
Max Iterations: 3

Step 1: Architect Agent
  Task: "Design microservices architecture for e-commerce platform"
  Initial Attempt: true

Step 2: Validator Agent
  Task: "Validate architecture against production requirements"
  Validation Criteria:
    - Security: OWASP compliance
    - Scalability: Handles 10M requests/day
    - Cost: Under $20K monthly
    - Reliability: 99.9% uptime capability

  If validation fails:
    - Extract specific issues
    - Generate improvement suggestions
    - Feed back to Architect Agent (Step 1)

  If validation passes:
    - Proceed to Step 3

Step 3: Scribe Agent
  Task: "Document approved architecture"
  Input: Validated architecture from final iteration
```

**Iteration Example:**

**Iteration 1:**
- Architect designs architecture
- Validator finds: "No disaster recovery plan, single point of failure in database"
- Status: FAIL
- Feedback to Architect: "Add multi-region deployment, database replication"

**Iteration 2:**
- Architect refines with DR and replication
- Validator finds: "Cost estimate exceeds $20K budget"
- Status: FAIL
- Feedback to Architect: "Optimize database tier, use serverless compute"

**Iteration 3:**
- Architect optimizes for cost
- Validator confirms: All criteria met
- Status: PASS
- Proceed to documentation

**Benefits:**
- Higher quality outputs
- Built-in quality gates
- Automatic refinement
- Reduces manual review cycles

**When Not to Use:**
- Simple tasks not requiring iteration
- Strict time constraints
- Deterministic outputs (no improvement needed)
- High cost sensitivity (more iterations = higher cost)

---

#### 4. Dynamic Workflows

**Description:**
Execution path determined at runtime based on agent outputs. Supports conditional branching and dynamic agent handoffs.

**Visualization:**
```
Start → Architect → Decision Point → Complex?
                                       ↓ Yes        ↓ No
                                    Builder A   Builder B
                                       ↓              ↓
                                    Validator ← ←──────
                                       ↓
                                    Complete
```

**Best For:**
- Unpredictable execution paths
- Conditional logic based on agent outputs
- Adaptive workflows
- Complex decision trees

**Example Use Case: Adaptive Development**
```yaml
Workflow: "Smart Feature Development"
Pattern: Dynamic

Step 1: Architect Agent
  Task: "Analyze feature requirements and recommend approach"
  Output:
    complexity: "high" | "medium" | "low"
    recommended_approach: "microservices" | "monolithic" | "serverless"

Step 2: Decision Node
  Condition: architecture.complexity

  If "high":
    Route to: Specialist Builder Agent
    Additional Validation: Required

  If "medium":
    Route to: Standard Builder Agent
    Additional Validation: Standard

  If "low":
    Route to: Fast Builder Agent (GPT-3.5-Turbo)
    Additional Validation: Optional

Step 3: Builder Agent (Selected dynamically)
  Task: Implementation based on architecture

Step 4: Conditional Validation
  If complexity == "high":
    Run: Security Validator + Performance Validator + Code Quality Validator
  Else:
    Run: Standard Validator

Step 5: Scribe Agent
  Task: Generate documentation
  Detail Level: Based on complexity
```

**Dynamic Agent Handoff Example:**

**Scenario: Security Issue Detected**
```yaml
Step 1: Standard Builder
  Output: Implementation with potential security issue

Step 2: Validator
  Finds: SQL injection vulnerability (Critical)
  Decision: Hand off to Security Specialist Builder

Step 3: Security Specialist Builder
  Task: "Fix SQL injection vulnerability"
  Input: Original code + vulnerability details
  Output: Secured implementation

Step 4: Validator (Re-check)
  Confirms: Vulnerability fixed
  Proceed to completion
```

**Benefits:**
- Highly flexible and adaptive
- Optimizes path based on actual needs
- Efficient resource utilization
- Handles complex scenarios gracefully

**When Not to Use:**
- Simple, predictable workflows
- Strict process compliance required
- Debugging complexity is a concern
- Team unfamiliar with dynamic patterns
