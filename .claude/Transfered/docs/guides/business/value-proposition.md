### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

Agent Studio supports four primary orchestration patterns designed to address different business scenarios:

#### 1. Sequential Workflows
**Business Use Case:** Multi-step processes where each stage depends on the previous (loan approval, order fulfillment)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Tasks execute in strict order: A → B → C → D
- State passed between agents via checkpoints
- Automatic rollback on failure with compensation logic
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

**Performance:** 3.2s average execution time (P95) per agent

#### 2. Parallel Workflows
**Business Use Case:** Independent analyses that can run concurrently (risk assessment, compliance checks)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Tasks execute simultaneously: A ∥ B ∥ C ∥ D
- Dependency graph resolves optimal execution order
- Results aggregated before downstream processing
- Fan-out/fan-in pattern for scalability

**Performance:** 40% faster than sequential for independent tasks

#### 3. Iterative Workflows
**Business Use Case:** Processes requiring validation and refinement (document generation, content moderation)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Builder agent creates output → Validator agent reviews → Loop until approved
- Configurable max iterations to prevent infinite loops
- Quality metrics tracked for continuous improvement
- Human-in-the-loop escalation for edge cases

**Performance:** Average 2.3 iterations to completion

#### 4. Dynamic Workflows
**Business Use Case:** Complex scenarios requiring runtime decision-making (customer support triage, incident response)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Agent coordinator determines next steps based on context
- Handoff between specialized agents as needed
- Adaptive routing based on confidence scores
- Group chat pattern for collaborative problem-solving

**Performance:** Handles 15+ agent handoffs with <500ms overhead
