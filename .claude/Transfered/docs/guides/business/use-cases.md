## Industry Applications

### Financial Services

The financial services industry faces unprecedented pressure to detect fraud in real-time, assess risk accurately, ensure regulatory compliance, and deliver personalized customer experiences—all while managing exponential data growth and evolving threats.

#### 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection & Prevention

**The Problem**

A multinational bank processed 50 million transactions daily across 40 countries, losing $180M annually to fraud. Traditional rule-based systems generated 85% false positives, overwhelming fraud analysts and creating customer friction. Detection lag averaged 4-6 hours, allowing fraudsters to exploit vulnerabilities before alerts triggered.

**The Solution**

Agent Studio orchestrates a multi-agent fraud prevention system with five specialized agents working in concert:

- **Transaction Analyzer Agent**: Examines transaction patterns, amounts, velocities, and geolocation data in real-time
- **Risk Scoring Agent**: Applies ML models to calculate fraud probability based on 200+ features
- **Pattern Detection Agent**: Identifies emerging fraud patterns using unsupervised learning
- **Customer Profile Agent**: Maintains behavioral baselines and detects anomalies
- **Alert Management Agent**: Prioritizes alerts, routes to appropriate teams, and triggers automated responses

The workflow processes each transaction through parallel analysis paths, combining results to make sub-second decisions. When fraud probability exceeds 75%, the system automatically blocks transactions and notifies customers. Medium-risk transactions (40-75%) trigger enhanced verification. All decisions include complete audit trails for regulatory compliance.

**Architecture**: Use domain events to trigger agent workflows and enable loose coupling between systems.

```typescript
// Event-driven workflow trigger
interface WorkflowTrigger {
  eventType: string;
  filter?: EventFilter;
  workflow: WorkflowDefinition;
}

const fraudDetectionTrigger: WorkflowTrigger = {
  eventType: 'transaction.created',
  filter: {
    amount: { greaterThan: 1000 },
    location: { notIn: ['trusted_locations'] }
  },
  workflow: {
    id: 'fraud-detection-v2',
    stages: [
      {
        name: 'parallel-analysis',
        agents: ['transaction-analyzer', 'customer-profiler', 'pattern-detector'],
        execution: 'parallel',
        timeout: '5s'
      },
      {
        name: 'risk-scoring',
        agents: ['risk-scorer'],
        dependsOn: ['parallel-analysis'],
        qualityGates: [
          { type: 'confidence', threshold: 0.85 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

    name: str
    action: Callable
    compensation: Callable

class SagaOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, steps: List[SagaStep]):
        self.steps = steps
        self.executed_steps = []

    async def execute(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        try:
            for step in self.steps:
                result = await step.action(context)
                context.update(result)
                self.executed_steps.append(step)
            return context
        except Exception as e:
            # Compensate in reverse order
            for step in reversed(self.executed_steps):
                await step.compensation(context)
            raise SagaFailureException(f"Saga failed at {step.name}: {e}")

# Credit approval saga
credit_approval_saga = SagaOrchestrator([
    SagaStep(
        name="credit_pull",
        action=pull_credit_report,
        compensation=log_credit_inquiry_cancellation
    ),
    SagaStep(
        name="income_verification",
        action=verify_income,
        compensation=clear_income_verification
    ),
    SagaStep(
        name="decision_recording",
        action=record_decision,
        compensation=reverse_decision
    ),
    SagaStep(
        name="notification",
        action=notify_applicant,
        compensation=send_cancellation_notice
    )
])
```

**Benefits**:

from typing import AsyncGenerator

class StreamingAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, window_size: timedelta, slide_interval: timedelta):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.slide_interval = slide_interval

    async def analyze_sensor_stream(
        self,
        sensor_stream: AsyncGenerator
    ) -> AsyncGenerator:
        window_buffer = []

        async for sensor_reading in sensor_stream:
            window_buffer.append(sensor_reading)

            # Prune old readings outside window
            cutoff = sensor_reading.timestamp - self.window_size
            window_buffer = [r for r in window_buffer if r.timestamp > cutoff]

            # Analyze window
            if len(window_buffer) >= 100:  # Minimum samples
                anomaly_score = await self.detect_anomalies(window_buffer)
                failure_probability = await self.predict_failure(window_buffer)

                if failure_probability > 0.75:
                    yield MaintenanceAlert(
                        equipment_id=sensor_reading.equipment_id,
                        probability=failure_probability,
                        recommended_action=self.get_recommendation(anomaly_score),
                        time_to_failure=self.estimate_ttf(window_buffer)
                    )

    async def detect_anomalies(self, window: list) -> float:
        # Isolation Forest or LSTM-based anomaly detection
        features = self.extract_features(window)
        return await self.anomaly_model.predict(features)

// Create patient context
CREATE (p:Patient {id: 'P12345', age: 67, gender: 'M'})
CREATE (s1:Symptom {name: 'chest_pain', severity: 8, onset: '2h_ago'})
CREATE (s2:Symptom {name: 'shortness_of_breath', severity: 7})
CREATE (h:History {condition: 'hypertension', duration: '10_years'})
CREATE (m:Medication {name: 'lisinopril', dose: '20mg', frequency: 'daily'})

CREATE (p)-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s1)
CREATE (p)-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s2)
CREATE (p)-[:HAS_HISTORY]->(h)
CREATE (p)-[:TAKES]->(m)

// Reasoning query: Find potential diagnoses
MATCH (p:Patient)-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom)
MATCH (p)-[:HAS_HISTORY]->(h:History)
MATCH (d:Diagnosis)-[:INDICATED_BY]->(s)
MATCH (d)-[:RISK_FACTOR]->(h)
WHERE d.probability > 0.6
RETURN d.name,
       d.probability,
       collect(s.name) as supporting_symptoms,
       d.recommended_tests as next_steps
ORDER BY d.probability DESC
LIMIT 5

// Result: Acute Coronary Syndrome (92% probability)
```

# Ensemble approach for quality defect detection
from typing import List, Dict
import numpy as np

class EnsembleQualityControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vision_model = VisionDefectDetector()  # CNN
        self.sensor_model = SensorAnomalyDetector()  # XGBoost
        self.process_model = ProcessQualityPredictor()  # LSTM

    async def inspect_product(
        self,
        images: List[np.ndarray],
        sensor_data: Dict,
        process_params: Dict
    ) -> QualityResult:
        # Parallel model execution
        vision_result = await self.vision_model.predict(images)
        sensor_result = await self.sensor_model.predict(sensor_data)
        process_result = await self.process_model.predict(process_params)

        # Weighted voting with confidence consideration
        defect_scores = [
            (vision_result.defect_score, vision_result.confidence, 0.5),  # weight
            (sensor_result.defect_score, sensor_result.confidence, 0.3),
            (process_result.defect_score, process_result.confidence, 0.2)
        ]

        ensemble_score = sum(
            score * confidence * weight
            for score, confidence, weight in defect_scores
        ) / sum(conf * weight for _, conf, weight in defect_scores)

        # Defect classification with explainability
        if ensemble_score > 0.85:
            defects = self.classify_defects([
                vision_result.findings,
                sensor_result.anomalies,
                process_result.root_causes
            ])

            return QualityResult(
                verdict='REJECT',
                confidence=ensemble_score,
                defects=defects,
                reasoning=self.generate_explanation(defect_scores)
            )
        else:
            return QualityResult(verdict='PASS', confidence=1 - ensemble_score)
```

**Benefits**:

### Performance Optimization Patterns

#### 1. Agent Result Caching

```typescript
// Redis-based agent result caching
class CachedAgentExecutor {
  private redis: RedisClient;
  private ttl: number = 3600; // 1 hour

  async execute(agent: Agent, input: AgentInput): Promise<AgentOutput> {
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(agent, input);

    // Check cache
    const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
    if (cached) {
      return JSON.parse(cached);
    }

    // Execute agent
    const result = await agent.execute(input);

    // Cache result with TTL
    await this.redis.setex(cacheKey, this.ttl, JSON.stringify(result));

    return result;
  }

  private generateCacheKey(agent: Agent, input: AgentInput): string {
    // Create deterministic cache key
    const inputHash = crypto
      .createHash('sha256')
      .update(JSON.stringify(input))
      .digest('hex');
    return `agent:${agent.id}:${inputHash}`;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Parallel Execution with Circuit Breaker

```python
# Resilient parallel agent execution
import asyncio
from circuitbreaker import circuit

class ParallelExecutor:
    def __init__(self, max_failures: int = 5, timeout: int = 30):
        self.max_failures = max_failures
        self.timeout = timeout

    @circuit(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60)
    async def execute_with_fallback(self, agent, input_data):
        try:
            return await asyncio.wait_for(
                agent.execute(input_data),
                timeout=self.timeout
            )
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            # Return degraded result
            return agent.get_fallback_result(input_data)

    async def execute_parallel_agents(
        self,
        agents: List[Agent],
        input_data: dict
    ) -> dict:
        # Execute all agents in parallel with circuit breaker
        tasks = [
            self.execute_with_fallback(agent, input_data)
            for agent in agents
        ]

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

        # Filter successful results
        successful = {
            agent.id: result
            for agent, result in zip(agents, results)
            if not isinstance(result, Exception)
        }

        return successful
```

### Observability Implementation

```typescript
// OpenTelemetry instrumentation for agent workflows
import { trace, context, SpanStatusCode } from '@opentelemetry/api';
import { W3CTraceContextPropagator } from '@opentelemetry/core';

class ObservableWorkflowExecutor {
  private tracer = trace.getTracer('agent-studio-workflow');

  async executeWorkflow(workflow: Workflow, input: any): Promise<any> {
    // Create root span for workflow
    return await this.tracer.startActiveSpan(
      `workflow.${workflow.name}`,
      {
        attributes: {
          'workflow.id': workflow.id,
          'workflow.version': workflow.version,
          'input.size': JSON.stringify(input).length
        }
      },
      async (span) => {
        try {
          const result = await this.executeStages(workflow.stages, input);

          span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK });
          span.setAttribute('output.size', JSON.stringify(result).length);

          return result;
        } catch (error) {
          span.setStatus({
            code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR,
            message: error.message
          });
          span.recordException(error);
          throw error;
        } finally {
          span.end();
        }
      }
    );
  }

  private async executeStages(stages: Stage[], input: any): Promise<any> {
    let context = input;

    for (const stage of stages) {
      // Create child span for each stage
      const stageResult = await this.tracer.startActiveSpan(
        `stage.${stage.name}`,
        { attributes: { 'stage.type': stage.execution } },
        async (span) => {
          const result = await this.executeAgents(stage.agents, context);
          span.setAttribute('agents.count', stage.agents.length);
          span.end();
          return result;
        }
      );

      context = { ...context, ...stageResult };
    }

    return context;
  }
}
```
