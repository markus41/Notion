# ADR-001: Use React with TypeScript for Webapp

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework and language for the Agent Framework webapp. The webapp needs to support:
- Complex visualizations (React Flow, D3/VisX)
- Real-time updates (traces, agent status)
- Code editing (Monaco Editor)
- Responsive design
- Good developer experience

## Decision
We will use **React 18** with **TypeScript** for the webapp.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Large ecosystem**: Extensive library support for required features
- **Type safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
- **Developer experience**: Excellent tooling and IDE support
- **Performance**: React 18 features (concurrent rendering, automatic batching)
- **Component reusability**: Easy to build and share components
- **Strong community**: Large community and abundant resources

### Negative
- **Learning curve**: Team members must learn TypeScript if unfamiliar
- **Build complexity**: Requires compilation step
- **Bundle size**: React can produce larger bundles than some alternatives

### Neutral
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - **Vue.js**: Simpler but smaller ecosystem for our specific needs
  - **Svelte**: Smaller bundle but less mature ecosystem
  - **Angular**: Too heavy for our use case

## Implementation Notes
- Use Vite for build tooling (fast, modern)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (utility-first)
- Use React Router for navigation
- Use Vitest for testing (Vite-native)
