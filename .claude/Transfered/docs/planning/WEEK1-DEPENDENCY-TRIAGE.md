## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk: MEDIUM

**Risk Breakdown:**
```
CRITICAL Security Risk:  0% (no vulnerabilities)
Breaking Change Risk:    35% (8 major updates, well-managed)
Build Failure Risk:      15% (Vite 7, ESLint 9 need testing)
Regression Risk:         10% (comprehensive test coverage mitigates)
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ✅ Phased merge approach (safe → breaking)
2. ✅ Feature branch testing for breaking changes
3. ✅ CI validation after each merge
4. ✅ Rollback plan (git revert if issues)

---

## Security Validation

**npm audit status**: PENDING (run after safe merges)

**Action Required:**
```bash
# After Phase 1 merges, run:
cd webapp && npm audit
cd src/webapp && npm audit
cd tools/mcp-tool-stub && npm audit

# Expected: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH vulnerabilities
# If any found: Address immediately (create hotfix PR)
```

**Trivy scan status**: PENDING

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Scan .NET services
trivy fs services/dotnet/ --severity CRITICAL,HIGH

# Expected: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH vulnerabilities
```

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 8 safe PRs merged without issues
- ✅ All CI pipelines GREEN after merges
- ✅ No new test failures introduced

**Phase 3 Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Vite 7 builds successfully
- ✅ ESLint 9 runs without errors
