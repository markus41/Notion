### 6 Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Benefit |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **DAG Builder** | Parse commands → dependency graphs | Enables parallelization |
| **Context Manager** | Cache shared analysis | 80% less redundant work |
| **Parallel Scheduler** | Execute independent agents in parallel | 60% time reduction |
| **Resource Manager** | Prevent resource contention | Zero deadlocks |
| **Recovery Manager** | Auto-rollback on failure | 95% recovery rate |
| **Progress Tracker** | TodoWrite integration | 100% visibility |

## 🔧 Core Concepts

### 1. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

**What**: Dependency graph of agent execution

**Example**:
```
Level 0: Agent A, Agent B, Agent C (parallel)  ← No dependencies
    ↓
Level 1: Agent D (depends on A, B)
    ↓
Level 2: Agent E (depends on D)
```

**Key Point**: Agents at same level run in **parallel**

---

### 2. Context Sharing

**What**: Cached analysis results shared across agents

**Example**:
```typescript
// Agent A analyzes codebase
context.set("codebase-analysis", analysisResult, ttl=3600);

// Agent B reuses (cache hit, instant)
const analysis = await context.get("codebase-analysis");
```

**Key Point**: **Immutable** contexts prevent corruption

---

### 3. TodoWrite Integration

**What**: Auto-generated progress tracking from DAG

**Example**:
```
[in_progress] Level 0: Execute 3 agents
  [completed] └─ security-specialist
  [in_progress] └─ performance-optimizer
  [pending] └─ database-architect
[pending] Level 1: Execute 2 agents
```

**Key Point**: **Automatic** - no manual effort

---

### 4. Saga Pattern (Failure Recovery)

**What**: Each agent defines execute() + compensate()

**Example**:
```typescript
agent.execute = async () => { createDatabase(); };
agent.compensate = async () => { dropDatabase(); };

// On failure: Run compensations in reverse order
```

**Key Point**: **Automatic rollback** on failure

---

## 📖 Command Examples

### Before: Sequential Execution
```
Phase 1: Agent A (10min) → Done
Phase 2: Agent B (10min) → Done
Phase 3: Agent C (10min) → Done
Total: 30 minutes
```

### After: Parallel Execution
```
Level 0: Agent A, B, C (parallel, 10min) → All Done
Total: 10 minutes (67% faster!)
```

## 📝 Best Practices

### For Command Authors

#### ✅ DO
- Define explicit dependencies between agents
- Use TodoWrite universally (auto-generated)
- Design for parallelization (minimize sequential deps)
- Implement compensation logic for rollback

#### ❌ DON'T
- Hardcode sequential execution
- Skip TodoWrite integration
- Create circular dependencies
- Ignore failure recovery

---

### For Agent Developers

#### ✅ DO
- Define agent capabilities clearly
- Accept and return enriched context
- Make agents idempotent (safe to retry)
- Provide compensation logic

#### ❌ DON'T
- Re-analyze context (check cache first)
- Crash on errors (return gracefully)
- Modify mutable state
- Create resource contention

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Command runs sequentially instead of parallel

**Symptom**: All agents execute one at a time
**Cause**: Dependencies not defined, or all agents depend on each other
**Solution**: Review DAG - ensure independent agents have no dependencies

---

### Issue: Low context cache hit rate

**Symptom**: Agents re-analyze same code repeatedly
**Cause**: Context not being stored or TTL expired
**Solution**: Check Context Manager configuration, increase TTL if needed

---

### Issue: Resource contention / deadlocks

**Symptom**: Agents wait indefinitely for resources
**Cause**: Multiple agents trying to access same resource
**Solution**: Check Resource Manager locks, adjust timeouts

---

### Issue: TodoWrite not updating

**Symptom**: No progress visible to user
**Cause**: Progress Tracker not initialized or not updating
**Solution**: Ensure `progressTracker.initialize(dag)` called at start

---

### Issue: Failure recovery not triggering

**Symptom**: Failed orchestrations leave inconsistent state
**Cause**: Compensation logic not defined or Recovery Manager not configured
**Solution**: Ensure all agents have `compensate()` functions

---

## 🎓 Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **DAG** | Directed Acyclic Graph - dependency graph with no cycles |
| **Node** | Agent in the DAG |
| **Edge** | Dependency between agents |
| **Level** | Set of agents that can run in parallel |
| **Context** | Shared cache of analysis results |
| **Saga** | Failure recovery pattern with compensation |
| **Compensation** | Rollback action for an agent |
| **Checkpoint** | Saved state for recovery |
| **TodoWrite** | Progress tracking UI |

## 📊 Performance Formulas

### Execution Time Reduction
```
Speedup = (SequentialTime - ParallelTime) / SequentialTime × 100%
```

**Example**:
```
Sequential: 150 min
Parallel: 55 min
Speedup = (150 - 55) / 150 × 100% = 63% faster
```

### Parallelization Efficiency
```
Efficiency = ActualSpeedup / TheoreticalSpeedup
```

**Example**:
```
10 agents, 3 run in parallel
Theoretical: 10x speedup
Actual: 3x speedup
Efficiency = 3/10 = 30%
```

### Context Cache Hit Rate
```
HitRate = CacheHits / (CacheHits + CacheMisses) × 100%
```

**Target**: >80%

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Tip #1: Start with Analysis
Before optimizing, understand the current critical path:
```bash
# Analyze command execution time
grep "Phase.*min" .claude/commands/performance-surge.md

# Identify bottlenecks
# Look for long sequential phases
```

### Tip #2: Visualize the DAG
Use Mermaid to visualize dependencies:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent A] --> D[Agent D]
    B[Agent B] --> D
    C[Agent C] --> E[Agent E]
    D --> E
```

### Tip #3: Measure Cache Effectiveness
Track cache hit rate:
```typescript
const hitRate = cacheHits / (cacheHits + cacheMisses);
console.log(`Cache hit rate: ${(hitRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
// Target: >80%
```

### Tip #4: Test Parallel Execution
Validate parallelization with timing:
```typescript
const start = Date.now();
await Promise.all([agentA(), agentB(), agentC()]);
const duration = Date.now() - start;
// Should be ~max(agentA, agentB, agentC), not sum
```

### Tip #5: Monitor Recovery
Log all compensation actions:
```typescript
agent.compensate = async () => {
  console.log(`[RECOVERY] Compensating ${agent.name}`);
  await rollbackAction();
};
```
