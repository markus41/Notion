## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: DAG has circular dependencies
**Solution**: Review [DAG Validation](../architecture/orchestration-architecture.md#31-dag-builder) section

#### Issue: Context cache not working
**Solution**: Check [Context Manager Configuration](../architecture/orchestration-architecture.md#33-context-manager)

#### Issue: Agents executing sequentially instead of parallel
**Solution**: Review [Scheduler Implementation](../architecture/orchestration-architecture.md#32-parallel-scheduler)

#### Issue: High resource contention
**Solution**: Review [Resource Manager](../architecture/orchestration-architecture.md#34-resource-manager)

#### Issue: Failure recovery not triggering
**Solution**: Review [Recovery Manager](../architecture/orchestration-architecture.md#35-recovery-manager-saga-pattern)
