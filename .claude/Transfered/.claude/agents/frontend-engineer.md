### Performance Optimization

**Core Web Vitals:**
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Target < 2.5s by optimizing images, fonts, and critical rendering path
- **FID (First Input Delay):** Target < 100ms by minimizing JavaScript execution and using web workers
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Target < 0.1 by setting explicit dimensions and avoiding dynamic content insertion
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** Target < 1.8s by inlining critical CSS and deferring non-critical resources
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte):** Target < 600ms by optimizing server response and using CDN

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Implement route-based and component-based code splitting
- Apply lazy loading for below-the-fold content and images
