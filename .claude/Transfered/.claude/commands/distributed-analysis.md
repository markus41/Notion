# Distributed Systems Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of distributed systems using 10+ specialized agents with shared blackboard pattern for collaborative problem-solving and emergent insights.

## Purpose

Analyze complex distributed systems to identify architectural issues, performance bottlenecks, scalability limitations, data consistency problems, and failure modes using collaborative multi-agent intelligence.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **blackboard pattern** where specialized agents contribute domain-specific knowledge to a shared workspace, enabling emergent solutions through collaborative analysis.
