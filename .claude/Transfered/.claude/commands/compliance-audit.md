# Compliance Audit

Full regulatory compliance audit for GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, and other frameworks with gap analysis, remediation planning, and evidence collection.

## Purpose

Conduct comprehensive compliance audit against multiple regulatory frameworks to ensure legal and regulatory adherence, identify compliance gaps, create remediation plans, and prepare for external audits and certifications.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **parallel compliance assessment** pattern where framework-specific agents audit in parallel, then synthesize findings for cross-framework compliance optimization.

## Notes

- Compliance is ongoing, not one-time; establish continuous compliance
- Automated compliance monitoring recommended post-audit
- Regular internal audits (quarterly or semi-annually) maintain readiness
- Compliance evidence should be collected continuously, not just pre-audit
- Cross-framework control mapping reduces duplication of effort
- Third-party audit firms may have specific evidence requirements
- Compliance frameworks evolve; stay updated on regulatory changes
- Consider compliance-as-code for automated policy enforcement
- Engage legal counsel for regulatory interpretation
- Document compensating controls where full compliance isn't feasible
