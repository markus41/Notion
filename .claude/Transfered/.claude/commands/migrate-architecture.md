# Architecture Migration

Plan and execute major architecture migrations with zero downtime, including monolith-to-microservices, database migrations, cloud migrations, and technology stack changes.

## Purpose

Safely plan and execute complex architecture migrations with minimal risk, zero downtime, comprehensive rollback strategies, and data consistency guarantees through strategic migration patterns and phased execution.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **phased migration pattern** with blue-green, canary, and strangler fig patterns coordinated across planning, execution, validation, and rollback phases.

## Migration Patterns

### 1. Strangler Fig Pattern
- Gradually replace legacy system functionality
- New functionality routes to new system
- Legacy functionality routes to old system
- Incrementally migrate legacy features
- Eventually "strangle" the old system

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment
- Maintain two identical production environments
- Route traffic to blue (current) environment
- Deploy to green (new) environment
- Validate green environment
- Switch traffic to green
- Keep blue as rollback option

### 3. Canary Deployment
- Deploy new version to small subset of users (1-5%)
- Monitor metrics and error rates
- Gradually increase traffic (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Rollback if metrics degrade
- Full rollout once validated

### 4. Database Migration Patterns
- **Dual Write**: Write to both old and new databases
- **Read from Old, Write to Both**: Gradual migration
- **Read from New, Write to Both**: Validation phase
- **Read from New, Write to New**: Complete migration

### 5. API Versioning Patterns
- **URI Versioning**: `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`
- **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.api.v2+json`
- **Gradual Deprecation**: Maintain old versions during migration

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Data Loss**: Dual-write, checksums, reconciliation
- **Performance Degradation**: Load testing, canary deployment
- **Integration Failures**: Comprehensive integration testing
- **Schema Incompatibilities**: Backward-compatible changes

### Operational Risks
- **Rollback Complexity**: Automated rollback, tested procedures
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Comprehensive observability before migration
- **Skill Gaps**: Training, documentation, runbooks

### Business Risks
- **Customer Impact**: Gradual rollout, transparent migration
- **Revenue Loss**: Validation gates, error budgets
- **Compliance Issues**: Security review, compliance validation

## Estimated Execution Time

- **Simple Migration** (e.g., single service): 4-8 hours
- **Medium Migration** (e.g., database migration): 1-2 days
- **Complex Migration** (e.g., monolith to microservices - planning): 8-16 hours
- **Enterprise Migration** (complete plan): 3-5 days of planning

Note: Actual migration execution may take weeks to months depending on complexity, done in phases.

## Notes

- Migration is a journey, not a destination; plan for continuous improvement
- Always have a tested rollback plan before starting migration
- Communicate extensively with stakeholders throughout migration
- Automate as much as possible to reduce human error
- Monitor continuously during migration with real-time alerts
- Use feature flags to control migration scope and enable instant rollback
- Test rollback procedures as thoroughly as forward migration
- Document everything, especially "gotchas" and workarounds
- Consider hiring migration specialists for complex migrations
- Budget 20-30% more time than estimated for unexpected issues
- Celebrate small wins to maintain team morale during long migrations
