# Disaster Recovery Planning & Testing

Comprehensive disaster recovery planning, testing, and validation with RTO/RPO requirements, failover procedures, data backup strategies, and business continuity planning.

## Purpose

Design, implement, test, and validate comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plans to ensure business resilience against catastrophic failures, including data center outages, regional disasters, cyberattacks, and data corruption.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **scenario-based DR testing** pattern where disaster scenarios are simulated, recovery procedures executed, and business continuity validated across people, process, and technology dimensions.

- **Use Case**: Mission-critical systems, financial trading

### 2. Warm Standby (Active-Passive)
- **RTO**: Hours
- **RPO**: Minutes to hours (asynchronous replication)
- **Cost**: Moderate (partial DR infrastructure)
- **Use Case**: E-commerce, SaaS platforms

### 3. Cold Standby (Backup/Restore)
- **RTO**: Days
- **RPO**: Hours to day (periodic backups)
- **Cost**: Lowest (storage costs only)
- **Use Case**: Non-critical systems, archival

### 4. Pilot Light
- **RTO**: Hours
- **RPO**: Minutes (continuous replication, minimal compute)
- **Cost**: Low-moderate
- **Use Case**: Critical data with scalable compute

### 5. Backup & Restore

- **RPO**: Last backup (daily/weekly)
- **Cost**: Very low
- **Use Case**: Development/test environments

## Backup Strategy Best Practices

### 3-2-1 Backup Rule
- **3 copies** of data (1 primary + 2 backups)
- **2 different media types** (disk + tape, cloud + on-prem)
- **1 offsite copy** (different geographic location)

### 3-2-1-1-0 Enhanced Rule
- **3** copies of data
- **2** different media
- **1** offsite
- **1** offline/air-gapped (ransomware protection)
- **0** errors (verify all backups)

## Notes

- DR is not just technology; it's people, process, and technology
- Test DR procedures regularly; untested DR plans will fail
- Automate DR failover to reduce RTO and human error
- Document everything; in a disaster, memory is unreliable
- Communicate clearly during disasters; use status pages
- Learn from every DR test and incident; continuous improvement
- Budget for DR; downtime costs far exceed DR investment
- Consider regulatory requirements when designing DR
- Immutable backups protect against ransomware
- Air-gapped backups as last line of defense
- DR is an ongoing program, not a one-time project
