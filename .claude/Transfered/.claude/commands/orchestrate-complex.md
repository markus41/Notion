# Multi-Pattern Orchestration

Execute complex, multi-phase orchestration using advanced patterns including Plan-then-Execute, Hierarchical Decomposition, Blackboard, and Event Sourcing.

## Orchestration Strategy

Use the **master-strategist** agent to coordinate multiple specialized agents across all layers (Strategic, Tactical, Operational, Quality/Security) for comprehensive task execution.

## Available Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Plan-then-Execute (P-t-E)
- Generate comprehensive strategic plan
- Validate plan with security and compliance checks
- Execute tasks with continuous monitoring
- Re-plan dynamically when blockers encountered
- Verify outcomes and adapt strategy

### 2. Hierarchical Decomposition
- Recursively break down complex objectives into atomic tasks
- Maximum depth: 5 levels
- Automatic parallelization of independent tasks
- Bottom-up aggregation of results

### 3. Blackboard Pattern
- Shared knowledge space for collaborative problem-solving
- Multiple agents contribute specialized knowledge
- Continuous knowledge integration and synthesis
- Emergent solutions from agent collaboration

### 4. Event Sourcing
- Event-driven task coordination
- Append-only event log for complete audit trail
- State reconstruction from events
- Time-travel debugging and replay capability

## Execution Flow

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Use **master-strategist** to analyze requirements
   - Use **risk-assessor** to identify potential risks
   - Use **compliance-orchestrator** to check regulatory requirements
   - Use **architect-supreme** to design system architecture

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Use **plan-decomposer** to break down into tasks
   - Use **resource-allocator** to assign agents and resources
   - Generate dependency graph and critical path
   - Estimate timeline with confidence intervals

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Security review by **vulnerability-hunter**
   - Compliance check by **compliance-orchestrator**
   - Architecture review by **architect-supreme**
   - Risk assessment by **risk-assessor**

4. **Execution Phase**
   - Parallel execution of independent tasks
   - **state-synchronizer** maintains distributed state
   - **conflict-resolver** handles inter-agent conflicts
   - Real-time monitoring and adaptation

5. **Quality Assurance Phase**
   - **test-strategist** validates test coverage
   - **chaos-engineer** tests resilience
   - **security-specialist** conducts security audit
   - **performance-optimizer** validates performance

6. **Verification Phase**
   - Validate all acceptance criteria met
   - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Security and compliance sign-off
   - Documentation completeness check

## Agent Coordination

### Strategic Layer
- **master-strategist**: Overall orchestration and planning
- **architect-supreme**: System design and architecture decisions
- **risk-assessor**: Risk identification and mitigation
- **compliance-orchestrator**: Regulatory compliance

### Tactical Layer
- **plan-decomposer**: Task breakdown and scheduling
- **resource-allocator**: Resource optimization
- **conflict-resolver**: Conflict mediation
- **state-synchronizer**: State consistency

### Operational Layer
- **code-generator-typescript**: TypeScript implementation
- **code-generator-python**: Python implementation
- **api-designer**: API design and implementation
- **database-architect**: Database schema and queries
- **frontend-engineer**: UI/UX implementation
- **devops-automator**: Infrastructure and deployment

### Quality/Security Layer
- **test-strategist**: Test planning and coverage
- **chaos-engineer**: Resilience testing
- **vulnerability-hunter**: Security testing
- **cryptography-expert**: Encryption and security
- **senior-reviewer**: Code quality review
- **security-specialist**: Security audit
- **performance-optimizer**: Performance optimization
- **documentation-expert**: Comprehensive documentation

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Build Microservice with Full Security
```
/orchestrate-complex Create a user authentication microservice with:
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- OAuth2 integration (Google, GitHub)
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- SOC2 compliance
- 90%+ test coverage
- Complete API documentation
```

### Example 2: Implement Distributed System Feature
```
/orchestrate-complex Add real-time collaborative editing to the platform:
- Operational transformation or CRDTs
- WebSocket-based synchronization
- Conflict-free merging
- Offline support with sync
- Horizontal scalability
- End-to-end encryption
- GDPR compliance
```

### Example 3: Database Migration with Zero Downtime
```
/orchestrate-complex Migrate from PostgreSQL to multi-database architecture:
- Analyze current schema and queries
- Design sharding strategy
- Implement dual-write pattern
- Create migration scripts with rollback
- Zero-downtime deployment plan
- Data consistency validation
- Performance benchmarking
```

## Output

The orchestration will produce:

1. **Strategic Plan** - Comprehensive roadmap with phases, milestones, risks
2. **Task Breakdown** - Detailed tasks with dependencies and estimates
3. **Architecture Design** - System design with diagrams and ADRs
4. **Implementation** - Complete, tested, production-ready code
5. **Test Suite** - Comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E, chaos)
6. **Security Assessment** - Vulnerability scan and compliance report
7. **Documentation** - API docs, runbooks, architecture docs
8. **Deployment Plan** - Step-by-step deployment with rollback

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Test coverage >90%
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities addressed
- ✅ Compliance requirements satisfied
- ✅ Performance benchmarks achieved
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Production-ready deployment plan
- ✅ Rollback strategy validated

## Notes

- This command orchestrates 20+ specialized agents
- Execution time depends on complexity
- Real-time progress updates provided
- Automatic re-planning on blockers
- Complete audit trail maintained
