# Chaos Engineering & Resilience Testing

Comprehensive chaos engineering and resilience testing to validate system behavior under failure conditions, network partitions, resource exhaustion, and cascading failures.

## Purpose

Systematically inject controlled failures into your system to discover weaknesses, validate fault tolerance mechanisms, test disaster recovery procedures, and build confidence in system resilience before failures happen in production.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **controlled chaos pattern** where chaos agents inject failures while monitoring agents observe system behavior and recovery, coordinated to ensure safety and comprehensive coverage.

## Chaos Engineering Principles

### 1. Build a Hypothesis Around Steady State Behavior
- Define what "normal" looks like
- Establish measurable metrics
- Set acceptable thresholds

### 2. Vary Real-World Events
- Simulate realistic failure scenarios
- Include rare but impactful failures
- Test combinations of failures

### 3. Run Experiments in Production
- Production has conditions that can't be replicated
- Test in staging first, then production with controls
- Start small, increase blast radius gradually

### 4. Automate Experiments to Run Continuously
- Integrate chaos into CI/CD pipeline
- Schedule regular chaos experiments
- Build confidence through repetition

### 5. Minimize Blast Radius
- Start with smallest possible impact
- Use feature flags to limit scope
- Have rollback mechanisms ready
- Ensure safety mechanisms in place
