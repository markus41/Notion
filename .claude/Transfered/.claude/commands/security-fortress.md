# Security Fortress

Complete security hardening with threat modeling, penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and multi-framework compliance validation (OWASP, CWE, NIST).

## Purpose

Transform your application into a security fortress through comprehensive threat modeling, automated and manual penetration testing, vulnerability remediation, secure code review, and compliance validation against industry standards.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **hierarchical security assessment** pattern with specialized agents at each security layer, coordinated by a security orchestrator for comprehensive defense-in-depth analysis.

### Security Layer Architecture

                 │
    ┌────────────┴────────────┬────────────┐
