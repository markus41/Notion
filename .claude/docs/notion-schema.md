## Standard Operations Protocol

**ALWAYS follow this sequence to prevent duplicates and maintain data integrity:**

```
1. Search for existing content (use notion-search tool)
2. Fetch related items to understand structure (use notion-fetch tool)
3. Check existing relations (verify links before creating)
4. Propose action to user (describe what will be created/updated)
5. Execute with proper linking (create with all required relations)
```

**Example Protocol**:
```bash
# Step 1: Search
notion-search "AI cost optimization" type=internal

# Step 2: Fetch related
notion-fetch [idea-id-from-search]

# Step 3: Check relations
# Review existing Research/Builds linked to idea

# Step 4: Propose
"I'll create a new Research Hub entry for AI cost optimization feasibility,
linking to the existing Idea (ID: abc123) and tracking Azure OpenAI and
Power BI software costs."

# Step 5: Execute
notion-create-pages parent={data_source_id: "91e8beff..."}
  properties={
    "Research Topic": "AI cost optimization feasibility",
    "Origin Idea": [relation to abc123],
    "Software Used": [relation to Azure OpenAI, Power BI]
  }
```

## Key Relation Rules

### Rule 1: Software Tracker is Central Hub
**ALL databases link TO Software Tracker (never from)**

```
Ideas Registry → Software Tracker (Software Needed)
Research Hub → Software Tracker (Software Used)
Example Builds → Software Tracker (Software & Tools)
```

**Why**: Enables accurate cost rollups and utilization tracking

### Rule 2: Linear Innovation Progression
**Ideas → Research → Builds → Knowledge** (with links preserved)

```
1. Idea created (💡)
2. Research links to Idea (required)
3. Build links to Idea (required) + Research (if exists)
4. Knowledge links to Build/Research/Idea (depending on origin)
```

**Why**: Maintains lineage and enables tracking from concept to archive

### Rule 3: Every Build MUST Link Three Things
```
1. Origin Idea (required - where did this come from?)
2. Related Research (if research preceded build - preserve findings)
3. ALL Software & Tools (required - for cost rollup accuracy)
```

**Why**: Cost tracking depends on accurate software relations

### Rule 4: Agent Work MUST Link Context
**Agent Activity Hub entries link to related Innovation items**

```
Agent Activity → Idea (if working on idea)
Agent Activity → Research (if conducting research)
Agent Activity → Build (if building/deploying)
```

**Why**: Workflow continuity and context preservation

## Query Patterns

### Find Unused Software
```typescript
notion-search {
  query: "",
  data_source_url: "collection://13b5e9de-2dd1-45ec-839a-4f3d50cd8d06",
  filters: {
    // Software with Status = Active but no usage
  }
}
```

### Find Ideas Needing Research
```typescript
notion-search {
  query: "",
  data_source_url: "collection://984a4038-3e45-4a98-8df4-fd64dd8a1032",
  filters: {
    // Viability = "Needs Research"
  }
}
```

### Find Expiring Contracts (60 days)
```typescript
// Query Software Tracker where Days Until Renewal < 60
```

### Find High-Viability Ideas Ready for Build
```typescript
notion-search {
  query: "",
  data_source_url: "collection://984a4038-3e45-4a98-8df4-fd64dd8a1032",
  filters: {
    // Viability = "High" AND Status = "Active"
  }
}
```

---

## Common Operations

### Create Idea with Software Links
```typescript
// 1. Search for duplicates
notion-search { query: "AI cost optimization" }

// 2. Search for software
notion-search { query: "Azure OpenAI", data_source_url: "collection://13b5e9de..." }

// 3. Create idea
notion-create-pages {
  parent: { data_source_id: "984a4038..." },
  pages: [{
    properties: {
      "Idea Name": "AI-powered cost optimization",
      "Status": "Concept",
      "Viability": "Needs Research",
      "Software Needed": [{ id: "azure-openai-id" }]
    }
  }]
}
```

### Create Research Linked to Idea
```typescript
// 1. Fetch origin idea
notion-fetch { id: "idea-page-id" }

// 2. Create research
notion-create-pages {
  parent: { data_source_id: "91e8beff..." },
  pages: [{
    properties: {
      "Research Topic": "AI cost optimization feasibility",
      "Origin Idea": [{ id: "idea-page-id" }],
      "Research Type": "Feasibility Study",
      "Status": "Active"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Create Build with Full Relations
```typescript
// 1. Fetch idea and research
notion-fetch { id: "idea-page-id" }
notion-fetch { id: "research-page-id" }

// 2. Search for all software used
// (Azure Functions, Azure OpenAI, Application Insights, etc.)

// 3. Create build
notion-create-pages {
  parent: { data_source_id: "a1cd1528..." },
  pages: [{
    properties: {
      "Build Name": "AI Cost Optimizer",
      "Status": "Active",
      "Build Type": "MVP",
      "Origin Idea": [{ id: "idea-page-id" }],
      "Related Research": [{ id: "research-page-id" }],
      "Software & Tools": [
        { id: "azure-functions-id" },
        { id: "azure-openai-id" },
        { id: "app-insights-id" }
      ],
      "Repository URL": "https://github.com/brookside-bi/ai-cost-optimizer"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Relation property not found"
**Cause**: Using wrong property name or database doesn't have that relation
**Solution**:
1. Fetch the database to see schema: `notion-fetch { id: "database-url" }`
2. Use exact property name from schema
3. Verify relation points to correct database

### Issue: Cost rollup shows $0 despite software links
**Cause**: Relation not properly established or software has $0 cost
**Solution**:
1. Verify Software Tracker entries have Monthly Cost populated
2. Check relation is to correct database (Software & Tools property)
3. Ensure License Count > 0 in Software Tracker

### Issue: Can't find database by name
**Cause**: Notion MCP requires database ID or URL, not name
**Solution**:
1. Use data source IDs from this document
2. Or search first: `notion-search { query: "database-name" }`
3. Extract ID from search results

### Issue: Duplicate entries created
**Cause**: Skipped search-first protocol
**Solution**:
1. ALWAYS search before creating
2. Review search results carefully (check all fields, not just title)
3. If unsure, fetch existing item to compare

---

## Validation Checklist

**Before creating ANY Notion entry, verify:**

- ✅ Searched for duplicates (no exact matches found)
- ✅ Identified all required relations (Idea → Research → Build → Software)
- ✅ Fetched related items to understand current state
- ✅ Using correct data source ID for database
- ✅ Using exact property names from schema
- ✅ Proposed action to user (described what will be created)

**After creating Notion entry, verify:**

- ✅ All relations are established correctly
- ✅ Rollup formulas calculate as expected
- ✅ Status fields are accurate
- ✅ Cost tracking is reflected (if applicable)
