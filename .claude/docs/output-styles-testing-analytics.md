| **UltraThink Test** | 8-12 min | Qualitative analysis, tier classification | Core agents, production decisions, deep-dives |
| **Comparison Test** | 15-25 min | Side-by-side all 5 styles | New agents, optimal style discovery, benchmarking |
| **Interactive Test** | 10-20 min | Real-time feedback during generation | Problem diagnosis, style refinement, edge cases |

---

## Standard Testing

### Command Syntax

```bash
/test-agent-style <agent-name> <style-name> [options]

# Required Arguments:
<agent-name>    - Agent to test (e.g., @cost-analyst)
<style-name>    - Style to apply (technical-implementer, strategic-advisor, etc.)

# Options:
--task="..."    - Custom task description (default: agent's standard task)
--sync          - Sync results to Notion immediately
--metrics-only  - Skip full output, return metrics only (faster)
--interactive   - Provide real-time feedback during test
--ultrathink    - Enable deep analysis with tier classification
```

### Examples

**Basic Test**:
```bash
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor
```

**Custom Task**:
```bash
/test-agent-style @build-architect visual-architect --task="Design event-driven microservices architecture for real-time analytics platform with 10M daily events"
```

**Quick Metrics Check**:
```bash
/test-agent-style @compliance-orchestrator compliance-auditor --metrics-only --sync
```

## UltraThink Deep Analysis

### When to Use UltraThink

**Use UltraThink for**:
- **Core Agents**: Your top 10 most-used agents (e.g., @cost-analyst, @build-architect)
- **Production Decisions**: Before deploying agent+style to real stakeholders
- **Underperformers**: Diagnosing combinations with effectiveness <60
- **Quarterly Deep-Dives**: Comprehensive portfolio review

**Skip UltraThink for**:
- **Bulk Testing**: Testing all 185 combinations (use standard tests)
- **Quick Checks**: Validating minor style tweaks
- **Low-Priority Combos**: Rarely-used agent+style pairs

### Command Syntax

```bash
/test-agent-style <agent-name> <style-name> --ultrathink [--sync] [--interactive]

# Examples:
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --ultrathink --sync
/test-agent-style @build-architect visual-architect --ultrathink --interactive
```

## Comparison Testing

### Purpose

Discover optimal style by testing same task across all 5 styles simultaneously with side-by-side comparison.

### Command Syntax

```bash
/style:compare <agent-name> "<task-description>" [options]

# Options:
--styles=list    - Comma-separated subset (default: all 5)
--ultrathink     - Enable deep analysis for each style
--sync           - Sync all results to Notion
--format=type    - table|detailed|summary (default: table)

# Examples:
/style:compare @cost-analyst "Analyze Q4 spending for CFO presentation"
/style:compare @viability-assessor "Assess AI platform feasibility" --ultrathink
/style:compare @build-architect "Design architecture" --styles=visual-architect,technical-implementer
```

### Interpreting Comparison Results

**Sample Output**:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Style Comparison: @cost-analyst on "Analyze Q4 spending for CFO"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

| Style | Effectiveness | Clarity | Technical | Formality | Time | Tier |
|-------|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------|------|
| 💼 Strategic Advisor | 94/100 | 88% | 25% | 65% | 2.3s | 🥇 |
| 🎨 Visual Architect | 82/100 | 85% | 45% | 55% | 3.1s | 🥈 |
| 📘 Technical Impl. | 71/100 | 75% | 85% | 40% | 2.8s | 🥉 |
| 🎓 Interactive Teacher | 68/100 | 90% | 15% | 35% | 2.5s | 🥉 |
| ✅ Compliance Auditor | 55/100 | 70% | 30% | 95% | 4.2s | ⚪ |

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 Top Recommendation: 💼 Strategic Advisor

Why Strategic Advisor Wins:
  ✅ Highest effectiveness (94/100) - 12 points above next best
  ✅ Optimal business focus (25% technical) for CFO audience
  ✅ Professional formality (65%) matches executive expectations
  ✅ Fast generation (2.3s) enables quick iterations
  ✅ Strong Brookside BI brand voice consistency

Key Differentiators:
  • Strategic Advisor: ROI-focused, business value framing, clear recommendations
  • Visual Architect: Good visuals but slightly too technical for pure executive audience
  • Technical Impl: Way too technical (85% density) for CFO - avoid

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 Alternative Scenario: Use 🎨 Visual Architect When...
  • Presenting to mixed audience (CFO + CTO + dev leads)
  • Visual storytelling more important than text analysis
  • Trade-off: -12 effectiveness, +0.8s generation time

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🚩 Avoid: ✅ Compliance Auditor (55/100)
  • Overly formal (95%) alienates business audience
  • Checklist format inappropriate for financial analysis
  • Slowest generation (4.2s) without quality benefit
```

**Decision Framework**:

1. **Clear Winner (>10 point gap)**:
   - Use top style as default for this agent+task type
   - Document in team workflow
   - Periodic re-testing (quarterly) to validate maintained performance

2. **Close Competition (≤10 point gap)**:
   - Consider context: audience mix, presentation format, time constraints
   - Test both in real scenarios
   - Let user preference decide (both are acceptable)

3. **All Styles Poor (<60)**:
   - Agent may not be suited for task type
   - Consider different agent
   - Or create custom style tailored to agent's unique output

Performance Trends (30-day comparison):

  📈 Strategic Advisor: 86 → 94 (+8 points) - Strong improvement
     Contributing factors:
     - More executive-focused tasks (better style alignment)
     - Recent style refinement improving ROI framing

  ➡️ Visual Architect: 82 → 82 (0 change) - Stable performer
     Contributing factors:
     - Consistent task types maintaining baseline performance

  📉 Technical Implementer: 76 → 71 (-5 points) - Declining, investigate
     Contributing factors:
     - Mixed-audience tasks (poor fit for highly technical style)

- Agent across all styles: 5 tests (1 per style)
- Portfolio-wide trends: 30+ tests (statistical significance)

### Documentation Standards

**Always Document**:
- Test date and timeframe
- Agent and style tested
- Overall effectiveness score
- Key insights and recommendations
- Next steps or follow-up actions
