## At-a-Glance Metrics

**Overall Coverage**: **29%** (129 of 125 operations automated)

**Databases by Automation Status**:
- ğŸŸ¢ **Strong** (>60%): 1 database (Software & Cost Tracker: 70%)
- ğŸŸ¡ **Partial** (30-60%): 6 databases (Ideas: 60%, Research: 50%, Builds: 30%, Agent Activity: 50%, Styles: 50%, Tests: 43%)
- ğŸ”´ **Weak** (<30%): 1 database (Knowledge: 12.5%)
- âš« **None** (0%): 6 databases (Projects, Actions Registry, Data Sources, Integration Registry, Agent Registry, OKRs)

## Priority Gaps (Immediate Action)

### CRITICAL (P0) - This Week

1. **Actions Registry Bootstrap** - META database needs self-registration
   - Command: `/action:bootstrap`
   - Effort: 4 hours
   - Impact: Enable command tracking system

2. **Build Creation Workflow** - Missing core innovation operation
   - Command: `/build:create [name]`
   - Effort: 6 hours
   - Impact: Complete manual build creation path

3. **Build Software Linking** - Cost rollups broken without this
   - Command: `/build:link-software [build-name] [software-list]`
   - Effort: 4 hours
   - Impact: Accurate build cost tracking
