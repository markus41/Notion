```

**Step 3: Data Retrieval (morningstar-data-analyst)**
```javascript
// Morningstar API call
GET /equity/TSLA/fundamentals
→ Returns: Current price, PE ratio, EPS, revenue, market cap, debt-to-equity

// Store in Notion for reference
Create Notion page in "Financial Data Cache" database:
  - Ticker: TSLA
  - Retrieved: 2025-10-26 14:30 UTC
  - Data: {JSON payload}
  - TTL: 1 hour
```

**Step 4: Equity Analysis (financial-equity-analyst)**
```markdown
## Tesla (TSLA) Valuation Analysis

### Investment Thesis

**Bullish Case**:

- Autonomous driving technology potential upside

**Bearish Case**:
- High valuation (PE 65 vs auto industry avg 12)
- Increasing competition (BYD, legacy OEMs)
- Execution risk on production targets

**Verdict**: Hold (Fair Value: $245 vs Current: $258)

### Valuation
- **Current Price**: $258.42
- **Fair Value (DCF)**: $245.00 (5% downside)
- **PE Ratio**: 65.2 (vs sector avg 12.5)
- **PEG Ratio**: 2.1 (moderately expensive given growth)

## Migration Path to Microsoft Agent Framework

While currently operating within Claude Code's subagent model, this architecture is designed for eventual migration to Microsoft's agent framework. The preparation includes:

### Phase 1: Current State (Claude Code)
- Agents as markdown specifications in `.claude/agents/`
- Invoked via Task tool with `subagent_type` parameter
- Orchestration patterns implemented manually via sequential/parallel tool calls
- State management via hooks and JSON files

### Phase 2: Hybrid (Preparation)
- Document agent interactions as explicit APIs (inputs/outputs)
- Extract orchestration logic into reusable patterns
- Create team definitions as configuration files
- Implement agent registry with capability metadata
- Build monitoring/telemetry for agent performance

### Phase 3: Microsoft Agent Framework (Future)
- **Agent Definition**: Convert markdown specs to Microsoft agent manifests
- **Orchestration**: Leverage AutoGen native patterns (Round Robin, Hierarchical)
- **State Management**: Use Microsoft agent framework's built-in state
- **Deployment**: Host agents as Azure Functions or Container Apps
- **Integration**: Connect to Microsoft 365 Copilot ecosystem
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights for agent telemetry

**Key Architecture Decisions Supporting Migration**:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Input/Output Contracts**: Structured JSON for agent communication
3. **Orchestrator Pattern**: Clear delegation hierarchy (mirrors AutoGen)
4. **Stateless Execution**: Agents don't rely on local state (migrate easily)
5. **Microsoft-First**: All infrastructure already Azure-based
