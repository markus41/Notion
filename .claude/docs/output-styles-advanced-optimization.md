```

**Recommended Cadence**: Quarterly (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
**Time Investment**: 8-12 hours per quarter
**Expected Outcome**: +5-10 effectiveness points per optimization cycle

---

## Phase 1: Measure (Data Collection)

### Step 1.1: Generate Portfolio Report

```bash
/style:report --timeframe=90d --format=executive --export=.claude/reports/Q4-2025-portfolio-report.md
```

**Review Key Metrics**:
- Overall portfolio avg effectiveness (target: >80)
- Style performance distribution (which styles dominate?)
- Agent performance distribution (which agents struggle?)
- Trend analysis (improving, stable, or declining?)

### Step 1.2: Identify Problem Areas

**Query Notion Agent Style Tests for**:

**Underperformers (<60 effectiveness)**:
```sql
SELECT Agent, Style, "Overall Effectiveness", "UltraThink Tier", Status
FROM "Agent Style Tests"
WHERE "Overall Effectiveness" < 60
ORDER BY "Overall Effectiveness" ASC
```

**Declining Trends (>5 point drop in 30 days)**:
```sql
-- Manual analysis required: Compare recent tests to historical baselines
-- Look for agents/styles with negative trend arrows in reports
```

**Consistency Issues (high variance across tests)**:
```sql
SELECT Agent, Style, COUNT(*) as Tests,
       AVG("Overall Effectiveness") as AvgEffectiveness,
       STDEV("Overall Effectiveness") as Variance
FROM "Agent Style Tests"
GROUP BY Agent, Style
HAVING Variance > 5
ORDER BY Variance DESC
```

### Step 1.3: Prioritize Focus Areas

**Prioritization Matrix**:

| Category | Criteria | Priority |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Core agent + <60 effectiveness | P0 (Fix immediately) |
| **High** | Core agent + declining trend >5 pts | P1 (Fix this quarter) |
| **Medium** | Non-core agent + <60 effectiveness | P2 (Fix if time permits) |
| **Low** | Any agent + 60-74 effectiveness (Bronze) | P3 (Monitor, fix next quarter) |

**Focus on Top 5-10 Problem Combinations**:
- Select highest priority items from matrix
- Limit scope to manageable batch (5-10 combos)
- Document prioritization rationale

---

## Phase 2: Analyze (Root Cause Diagnosis)

### Step 2.1: Deep-Dive UltraThink Analysis

For each prioritized problem combination:

```bash
/test-agent-style @problem-agent problem-style --ultrathink --interactive --sync
```

**What to Look For**:

**Semantic Appropriateness Issues (<80)**:
- ❌ Factual inaccuracies in agent output
- ❌ Logical flow problems
- ❌ Incomplete coverage of required topics
- **Root Cause**: Agent knowledge gaps, outdated training data
- **Fix**: Update agent `.claude/agents/[agent].md` specification

**Audience Alignment Issues (<80)**:
- ❌ Tone mismatch (too casual or too formal)
- ❌ Technical density misaligned with audience
- ❌ Terminology inappropriate for readers
- **Root Cause**: Style transformation rules misaligned
- **Fix**: Refine `.claude/styles/[style].md` rules

**Brand Consistency Issues (<85)**:
- ❌ Missing Brookside BI language patterns
- ❌ Inconsistent voice (not professional but approachable)
- ❌ Solution-focus lacking
- **Root Cause**: Style not enforcing brand guidelines
- **Fix**: Strengthen brand voice integration in style definition

**Practical Effectiveness Issues (<80)**:
- ❌ Vague recommendations
- ❌ Missing actionable next steps
- ❌ No success metrics defined
- **Root Cause**: Style lacking actionability requirements
- **Fix**: Add "Actionability Rules" section to style

**Innovation Potential Issues (<75)**:
- ❌ Formulaic, template-like outputs
- ❌ No creative approaches
- ❌ Missing emerging trends consideration
- **Root Cause**: Style over-constraining agent creativity
- **Fix**: Loosen rigid rules, add "Innovation Encouragement" section

### Step 2.2: Pattern Recognition

**Look for Cross-Cutting Issues**:

**All technical styles underperforming?**
- **Pattern**: Over-technical for most audiences
- **Hypothesis**: Reduce technical density ceiling from 0.9 to 0.7
- **Test**: Re-test 3 agent+technical-implementer combos after adjustment

**All compliance tasks failing?**
- **Pattern**: Compliance Auditor style too rigid
- **Hypothesis**: Add flexibility for different compliance frameworks
- **Test**: Update style, re-test @compliance-orchestrator + compliance-auditor

**Strategic Advisor dominates everything?**
- **Pattern**: Universal appeal but may lack specificity
- **Hypothesis**: Strategic Advisor becoming "default" losing specialized value
- **Test**: Strengthen other styles' unique value propositions

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesize (Proposed Refinements)

### Hypothesis Template

```markdown
## Optimization Hypothesis #[N]

**Problem**: [Describe the issue with specific metrics]
@agent-name + style-name scores 58/100 (Needs Improvement tier)
Root cause: Low Audience Alignment (62/100) - too technical for executives

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- UltraThink shows 0.78 technical density (target: 0.2-0.3 for executives)
- Code examples present despite executive audience
- Missing business value framing

**Proposed Solution**:
Update strategic-advisor style definition:
1. Add rule: "For executive audience, technical density must be <0.3"
2. Add rule: "Replace code examples with business impact descriptions"
3. Add rule: "Lead every section with business value before technical details"

**Expected Impact**:
- Audience Alignment: 62 → 85 (+23 pts)
- Overall Effectiveness: 58 → 75 (+17 pts, Bronze → Silver tier)

**Test Plan**:
1. Update .claude/styles/strategic-advisor.md with new rules
2. Re-test @agent-name + strategic-advisor
3. Compare before/after metrics
4. If successful, apply pattern to similar underperformers

**Success Criteria**:
- Overall Effectiveness ≥ 75 (Silver tier minimum)
- Audience Alignment ≥ 80
- No regression in other dimensions (brand, semantic, practical)

**Rollback Plan**:
If effectiveness decreases or other dimensions regress:
- Revert style changes via git
- Document failed hypothesis in Knowledge Vault
- Try alternative approach
```

### Common Optimization Patterns

**Pattern 1: Technical Density Mismatch**

**Symptoms**:
- Low Audience Alignment scores
- Executives complaining outputs too technical
- Developers complaining outputs too business-focused

**Solution**:
```yaml
# In style definition, add Audience-Based Rules:

Audience Detection:
  - IF audience includes "executive", "CFO", "CEO", "leadership"
    THEN technical_density_target = 0.2-0.3
  - IF audience includes "developer", "engineer", "architect"
    THEN technical_density_target = 0.7-0.9
  - IF audience includes "mixed" or "cross-functional"
    THEN technical_density_target = 0.4-0.6

Enforcement:
  - Replace code blocks with business impact summaries (executive)
  - Include implementation details and examples (technical)
  - Balance both perspectives with clear sections (mixed)
```

**Pattern 2: Brand Voice Drift**

**Symptoms**:
- Low Brand Consistency scores (<85)
- Missing Brookside BI language patterns
- Generic outputs lacking consultative positioning

**Solution**:
```yaml
# In style definition, strengthen Brand Voice Integration:

Required Language Patterns (enforce in every output):
  1. Lead with "Establish..." framing (first paragraph)
  2. Include "Organizations scaling [technology]..." context
  3. Add "Best for: [specific use case]" qualifier
  4. Frame around outcomes: "streamline", "drive measurable outcomes"
  5. Position as strategic partner, not vendor

Quality Check (before finalizing output):
  - Count occurrences of core patterns (minimum 3 of 5)
  - Verify professional but approachable tone (no jargon overload)
  - Confirm solution-focus (outcome before feature in every section)
```

**Pattern 3: Actionability Gap**

**Symptoms**:
- Low Practical Effectiveness scores (<80)
- Outputs theoretical without implementation guidance
- Users asking "what do I do next?"

**Solution**:
```yaml
# In style definition, add Actionability Requirements:

Every Output Must Include:
  1. Concrete Next Steps section (numbered list, specific actions)
  2. Success Metrics (how to measure if implemented correctly)
  3. Time Estimates (realistic implementation duration)
  4. Resource Requirements (tools, team size, budget if applicable)
  5. Risk Mitigation (top 3 risks with mitigation strategies)

Format Standard:
  ✅ Good: "Deploy Azure Function with Bicep template (az deployment create...)"
  ❌ Bad: "Consider deploying serverless functions"

  ✅ Good: "Achieve <100ms latency (measure with Application Insights)"
  ❌ Bad: "Improve performance"
```

---

## Phase 4: Implement (Style Refinement)

### Step 4.1: Version Control Best Practices

**Before Making Changes**:

```bash
# Create optimization branch
git checkout -b optimization/Q4-2025-style-refinements

# Document baseline metrics
echo "Baseline: @cost-analyst + strategic-advisor = 58/100" > .claude/reports/optimization-log.md
```

### Step 4.2: Update Style Definitions

**Example: Refining Strategic Advisor**

```markdown
# Before (in .claude/styles/strategic-advisor.md):

## Output Transformation Rules

1. **Business Value Framing**: Lead with ROI and strategic impact
2. **Executive Language**: Use business terminology, minimal jargon
3. **Data-Driven**: Include metrics, benchmarks, financial analysis

# After (refined):

## Output Transformation Rules

### Core Transformation

1. **Business Value Framing**: Lead with ROI and strategic impact
   - EVERY section must start with business outcome before technical detail
   - Use format: "This enables [business value] through [technical approach]"
   - Example: "Streamline cost visibility (business value) through automated Azure tagging (technical)"

2. **Executive Language**: Use business terminology, minimal jargon
   - Technical density target: 0.2-0.3 for pure executive audience
   - Replace code examples with business impact descriptions
   - IF technical detail required, use "Technical Note" callout boxes

3. **Data-Driven**: Include metrics, benchmarks, financial analysis
   - Every recommendation needs quantified impact (%, $, time saved)
   - Format: "Expected ROI: $X savings over Y months (Z% reduction)"
   - Include industry benchmarks where available

### Audience-Specific Adjustments

**Executive-Only Audience** (CEO, CFO, VP):
- Technical density: 0.2-0.3 maximum
- Focus: Strategic impact, financial metrics, competitive positioning
- Avoid: Code snippets, implementation commands, technical acronyms

**Mixed Audience** (Executives + Technical Leads):
- Technical density: 0.4-0.5 balanced
- Focus: Business justification + high-level architecture
- Structure: Executive summary (business) → Technical appendix (implementation)

### Actionability Requirements

Every output must include:
1. **Concrete Next Steps**: Numbered list with specific actions and owners
2. **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes (e.g., "<100ms latency", "20% cost reduction")
3. **Timeline**: Realistic estimates ("2-3 weeks for Phase 1")
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Top 3 risks with mitigation strategies
```

### Step 4.3: Update Agent Specifications (If Needed)

**If root cause is agent knowledge gap**:

```markdown
# In .claude/agents/cost-analyst.md, add/update:

## Knowledge Base Updates (2025-10-23)

**Cost Optimization Strategies** (added Q4 2025):
- Azure Reserved Instances: 30-50% savings vs. pay-as-you-go
- Azure Hybrid Benefit: Up to 85% savings on Windows/SQL licenses
- Spot Instances: 60-90% savings for fault-tolerant workloads
- Right-sizing: Average 25% cost reduction through SKU optimization

**Industry Benchmarks** (updated Q4 2025):
- Typical Azure spend: $2-5 per user/month (SaaS applications)
- Cloud cost as % of revenue: 2-5% for software companies
- Cost optimization potential: 20-40% typical first-year savings
```

---

## Phase 5: Validate (Re-Testing)

### Step 5.1: A/B Comparison Testing

**Test refined style against baseline**:

```bash
# Baseline (before optimization)
git checkout main
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --sync

# Optimized (after refinement)
git checkout optimization/Q4-2025-style-refinements
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --sync --ultrathink

# Compare results in Notion Agent Style Tests database
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Overall Effectiveness: +10 points minimum
- Target dimension (e.g., Audience Alignment): +15 points minimum
- No regression in other dimensions (>3 point drop)

### Step 5.2: Consistency Validation

**Run same test 3 times**:

```bash
# Test 1
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --sync

# Test 2 (10-minute gap)
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --sync

# Test 3 (10-minute gap)
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --sync
```

**Calculate Variance**:
```javascript
const results = [87, 89, 88]; // effectiveness scores
const mean = results.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / results.length;
const variance = results.reduce((a, b) => a + Math.pow(b - mean, 2), 0) / results.length;
const stdDev = Math.sqrt(variance);

// Acceptable: stdDev < 5 points
// If stdDev ≥ 5, optimization may have introduced instability
```

### Step 5.3: Cross-Agent Validation

**If style-level optimization, test impact on other agents**:

```bash
# Primary agent (optimization target)
/test-agent-style @cost-analyst strategic-advisor --ultrathink

# Secondary agents (ensure no regression)
/test-agent-style @viability-assessor strategic-advisor
/test-agent-style @research-coordinator strategic-advisor
/test-agent-style @archive-manager strategic-advisor
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Primary agent: +10 points improvement ✅
- Secondary agents: No >5 point regression ✅
- At least 2 secondary agents show improvement (bonus!) ✅

---

## Phase 6: Document (Knowledge Capture)

### Step 6.1: Create Optimization Case Study

```markdown
# Knowledge Vault Entry Template

## Optimization Case Study: Strategic Advisor Audience Alignment (Q4 2025)

**Problem Statement**:
@cost-analyst + strategic-advisor scored 58/100 (Needs Improvement tier) due to low Audience Alignment (62/100). Root cause: 0.78 technical density overwhelmed executive audience with code examples and implementation details.

**Hypothesis**:
Enforce technical density <0.3 for executive audiences and replace code with business impact descriptions to improve Audience Alignment to 85+.

**Implementation**:
Updated `.claude/styles/strategic-advisor.md`:
- Added Audience-Specific Rules section with technical density targets
- Enforced business-value-first framing in all sections
- Replaced code examples with business impact summaries

**Results**:
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Overall Effectiveness | 58 | 87 | +29 ✅ |
| Audience Alignment | 62 | 91 | +29 ✅ |
| Brand Consistency | 75 | 92 | +17 ✅ |
| Practical Effectiveness | 70 | 88 | +18 ✅ |
| Tier | ⚪ Needs Improvement | 🥈 Silver | 2 tiers ✅ |

**Key Learnings**:
1. Technical density is critical dimension for audience alignment
2. Audience detection rules enable context-aware style adaptation
3. Business-value-first framing strengthens both brand and practical effectiveness
4. Cross-dimensional improvements possible (brand, practical lifted alongside audience)

**Reusable Pattern**:
Apply audience-specific technical density rules to:
- Technical Implementer (adjust for non-technical audiences)
- Visual Architect (balance visuals vs. text based on audience)
- Compliance Auditor (adjust formality for internal vs. external audits)

**Next Steps**:
1. Apply pattern to Technical Implementer style (Q1 2026)
2. Monitor @cost-analyst + strategic-advisor quarterly to ensure sustained performance
3. Test with real CFO presentation to validate real-world effectiveness

- Style definition: `.claude/styles/strategic-advisor.md` (commit abc123)
- UltraThink analysis: [Link to full report]
```

### Step 6.2: Update Team Documentation

**In team wiki/docs**:

```markdown
# @cost-analyst Style Guidelines (Updated 2025-10-23)

## Recommended Styles by Task Type

| Task Type | Recommended Style | Effectiveness | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Executive Cost Reports** | 💼 Strategic Advisor | 87/100 | Use for CFO/CEO presentations |
| **Technical Cost Audits** | 📘 Technical Implementer | 79/100 | Use for engineering deep-dives |
| **Team Cost Dashboards** | 🎨 Visual Architect | 82/100 | Use for cross-functional visibility |
| **New Hire Cost Training** | 🎓 Interactive Teacher | 74/100 | Use for onboarding materials |
| **Compliance Cost Docs** | ✅ Compliance Auditor | 55/100 | ⚠️ Avoid, poor fit for cost analysis |

Last Updated: 2025-10-23 | Next Review: 2026-01-23
```

### Step 6.3: Commit and Merge

```bash
# Commit changes

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Multi-Dimensional Optimization

**Goal**: Improve multiple dimensions simultaneously

**Approach**:
1. **Identify correlated dimensions**: Brand + Practical often move together
2. **Target root cause**: Fix agent knowledge gap → lifts semantic + practical
3. **Holistic refinements**: Update both style AND agent for maximum impact

**Example**:
```
Problem: @build-architect + visual-architect
  - Low Semantic (78)
  - Low Practical (75)

Root Cause Analysis:
  - Agent missing latest Azure architecture patterns (semantic)
  - Style lacking implementation guidance (practical)

Multi-Dimensional Fix:
  1. Update agent: Add Azure Well-Architected Framework knowledge
  2. Update style: Require IaC templates in all architecture outputs

Expected Impact:
  - Semantic: 78 → 92 (+14)
  - Practical: 75 → 90 (+15)
  - Overall: 81 → 94 (+13, Bronze → Gold)
```

### Technique 2: Custom Style Creation

**When to Create Custom Style**:
- Existing 5 styles all score <70 for specific use case
- Unique organizational communication requirements
- Niche audience not covered (e.g., "Data Scientist", "Regulatory Reviewer")

**Process**:

1. **Define Identity**:
```yaml
Style Name: Data Science Communicator
Category: Technical-Analytical
Target Audience: Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Research Teams
Purpose: Communicate statistical rigor with code reproducibility
```

2. **Establish Characteristics**:
```yaml
Technical Density: 0.8-0.9 (high, but balanced with statistical explanation)
Formality: 0.5-0.6 (professional but collaborative research tone)
Clarity: 0.7-0.8 (accessible to STEM backgrounds, not general public)
Visual Elements: High (plots, charts, equations)
Code Blocks: High (Jupyter notebooks, Python snippets, R scripts)
```

3. **Create Transformation Rules**:
```markdown
## Output Transformation Rules

1. **Statistical Rigor**: Every claim backed by quantitative evidence
   - Include confidence intervals, p-values, effect sizes
   - Explain statistical methodology clearly
   - Acknowledge limitations and assumptions

2. **Code Reproducibility**: Provide runnable examples
   - Use Jupyter notebook format when possible
   - Include seed values for random processes
   - Specify library versions (requirements.txt)

3. **Visual Data Communication**: Plot over tables
   - Include matplotlib/seaborn visualizations
   - Explain axes, scales, distributions
   - Highlight key insights with annotations
```

4. **Test Across 10 Agents**:
```bash
/test-agent-style @agent-1 data-science-communicator
/test-agent-style @agent-2 data-science-communicator
# ... (test 10 total)
```

5. **Validate Effectiveness >75 Average**:
- If avg <75, refine and re-test
- If avg ≥75, officially add to portfolio
- Document in Output Styles Registry

### Technique 3: Prompt Engineering for Styles

**Optimize style prompt structure for better adherence**:

**Before (weak enforcement)**:
```
Apply strategic-advisor style. Use business language.
```

**After (strong enforcement)**:
```
# CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS (must follow exactly):

1. Technical Density: <0.3 (business-focused)
   - NO code examples
   - Replace technical terms with business concepts
   - Example: "API rate limiting" → "request management controls"

2. Business Value Framing (required in EVERY section):
   - Lead with outcome: "This enables [business benefit]"
   - Include ROI: "$X savings" or "Y% improvement"
   - Strategic positioning: "Organizations scaling [technology]..."

3. Brand Voice (Brookside BI guidelines):
   - Professional but approachable tone
   - Use "Establish..." framing for main heading
   - Include "Best for: [use case]" context
   - Solution-focused: "streamline", "drive measurable outcomes"

4. Quality Gate (before responding):
   - Count "Best for:" occurrences (minimum: 1)
   - Check technical density <0.3 (calculate: technical_terms / total_words)
   - Verify business value in first paragraph

ONLY respond once all requirements confirmed.
```
