    participant Model
    participant Cache
    participant Monitor

    User->>API: Submit new idea
    API->>Cache: Check for similar ideas
    Cache-->>API: Return if exists
    API->>Model: Request viability score
    Model->>Model: Extract features
    Model->>Model: Apply XGBoost model
    Model->>API: Return score + confidence
    API->>Cache: Store result
    API->>Monitor: Log prediction

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR-002)

### ADR-002: Machine Learning Platform Selection for Innovation Nexus

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Proposed
**Deciders**: Markus Ahling (Engineering Lead), Alec Fielding (DevOps Lead)
**Tags**: #innovation-nexus #azure #machine-learning #mlops

#### Context

The Innovation Nexus requires machine learning capabilities to automate viability scoring, pattern mining, and predictive analytics across 500+ annual innovation initiatives. Manual assessment currently consumes 160 hours monthly with 60% accuracy for viability predictions.

**Business Requirements**:
- Automate viability assessment with >80% accuracy
- Identify cost optimization opportunities saving $5,000+ monthly
- Extract reusable patterns from 50+ repositories
- Support real-time and batch predictions
- Enable A/B testing for model improvements

**Technical Constraints**:
- Must integrate with existing Azure subscription (cfacbbe8-a2a3-445f-a188-68b3b35f0c84)
- Budget limit of $3,000/month for ML infrastructure
- Team expertise primarily in Python and Azure services
- Required 99.9% availability for production endpoints

**Current Situation**:
Manual processes lack scalability, consistency, and real-time capabilities. No existing ML infrastructure to leverage historical data for predictions.

#### Decision

**We will implement Azure Machine Learning as the primary ML platform for Innovation Nexus**

##### Detailed Description
Deploy Azure ML Workspace with automated pipelines for model training, versioning, and deployment. Integrate with existing Azure Data Factory for data ingestion from Notion, GitHub, and Azure DevOps. Establish MLOps practices with drift detection, automated retraining, and A/B testing capabilities.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Option 1: Azure Databricks
**Description**: Unified analytics platform with Spark-based processing and MLflow integration

**Pros**:
- ✅ Superior big data processing capabilities (10x faster for large datasets)
- ✅ Native Spark support for distributed computing
- ✅ Strong collaboration features with notebooks

**Cons**:
- ❌ Higher cost ($4,500+/month for comparable setup)
- ❌ Steeper learning curve for team without Spark expertise
- ❌ Overkill for current data volumes (<1TB)

**Why Rejected**: Cost exceeds budget by 50%, unnecessary complexity for current scale

##### Option 2: AWS SageMaker
**Description**: Amazon's fully managed ML service

**Pros**:
- ✅ Mature platform with extensive algorithm library
- ✅ Strong AutoML capabilities with Autopilot
- ✅ Excellent documentation and community support

**Cons**:
- ❌ Not aligned with Microsoft ecosystem strategy
- ❌ Additional complexity managing multi-cloud architecture
- ❌ Data egress costs from Azure ($500+/month)
- ❌ Separate identity management required

**Why Rejected**: Violates Microsoft-first strategy, adds operational complexity

##### Option 3 (SELECTED): Azure Machine Learning
**Description**: Microsoft's cloud-native ML platform integrated with Azure ecosystem

**Pros**:
- ✅ Native Azure integration reducing complexity by 40%
- ✅ Cost within budget ($2,485/month optimized)
- ✅ Seamless authentication with Azure AD
- ✅ Direct integration with Azure Data Factory and Synapse
- ✅ Managed endpoints with auto-scaling
- ✅ Built-in MLOps capabilities

**Cons**:
- ❌ Less mature than SageMaker (addressed by rapid improvements)
- ❌ Smaller algorithm library (mitigated by custom model support)

**Why Selected**: Optimal Microsoft ecosystem alignment, cost-effective, reduces operational complexity while meeting all requirements

#### Consequences

##### Positive Outcomes
- Reduces manual assessment time by 160 hours/month ($12,000 value)
- Improves viability prediction accuracy from 60% to 85%
- Enables real-time scoring reducing decision time from days to seconds
- Identifies $8,000+ monthly cost optimization opportunities
- Establishes scalable ML infrastructure supporting 10x growth

##### Negative Outcomes / Tradeoffs
- Requires 320 hours initial implementation effort
  - Mitigation: Phased rollout over 3 months
- Team needs Azure ML training (40 hours)
  - Mitigation: Microsoft Learn paths and hands-on workshops
- Vendor lock-in to Azure ecosystem
  - Mitigation: Aligned with organizational strategy

##### Risks
- **Risk 1**: Model drift reducing accuracy over time
  - Likelihood: High
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Automated drift detection and retraining triggers

- **Risk 2**: Cost overruns from compute resources
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Low
  - Mitigation: Aggressive auto-scaling, budget alerts at 80%

- **Risk 3**: Integration complexity with Notion API
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Proven Data Factory connectors, retry logic
