### Repository Scanning Strategy
For each repository in Repository Inventory:
- Scan code files for API endpoint patterns
- Detect authentication configuration files
- Identify webhook implementations
- Extract database connection strings (sanitized)
- Find third-party service SDK imports
- Detect MCP server configurations

### File Patterns to Analyze
```

## 5. Security Review Assessment

### Automated Security Checks

**Check 1: Credential Hardcoding Detection üö®**
```
Scan for:
- API keys in code files (not .env or Key Vault references)
- Passwords in connection strings
- Secrets in Git history
- Hardcoded tokens

If detected:
  Security Review Status = "Failed"
  Alert user immediately
  Provide remediation guidance (move to Key Vault)
```

**Check 2: HTTPS Enforcement ‚úÖ**
```
Scan for:
- HTTP (not HTTPS) endpoints in production code
- Mixed content warnings
- Insecure redirect URLs

If HTTP found:
  Security Review Status = "Needs Review"
  Recommendation: Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints
```

**Check 3: Authentication Present ‚úÖ**
```
Scan for:
- Public API endpoints without authentication
- Missing authorization headers
- Anonymous access patterns

If unauthenticated:
  Security Review Status = "Needs Review"
  Recommendation: Implement authentication (Azure AD preferred)
```

**Check 4: Key Vault Usage ‚úÖ**
```
Scan for:
- Azure Key Vault SDK imports
- Key Vault secret references
- Environment variable patterns pointing to Key Vault

If using Key Vault:
  Security Review Status = "Approved"
  Best Practice: ‚úÖ Credentials securely managed
```

**Check 5: Managed Identity Usage ‚úÖ**
```
Scan for:
- ManagedIdentityCredential usage
- System-assigned or user-assigned identity configs

If using Managed Identity:
  Security Review Status = "Approved"
  Best Practice: ‚úÖ Best Azure authentication method
```

### Security Review Status Logic
```
IF hardcoded credentials detected:
  Status = "Failed"
ELSE IF no authentication on public endpoints:
  Status = "Needs Review"
ELSE IF using Key Vault AND (Azure AD OR Managed Identity):
  Status = "Approved"
ELSE IF using API keys from Key Vault:
  Status = "Approved"
ELSE:
  Status = "Needs Review"
```

## 6. Integration Registry Population

### Entry Creation Workflow

**Search Strategy:**
1. Search Integration Registry by repository relation
2. Check for existing integration by name or endpoint
3. If duplicate found, update instead of create
4. If new, create entry with all metadata

**Field Mapping (Code ‚Üí Integration Registry):**
```
Integration Registry Property    Source
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

   - Extract from API domain (e.g., api.openai.com ‚Üí OpenAI)
   - Check SDK package name (e.g., @azure/openai ‚Üí Azure OpenAI)
   - Match configuration service names

2. **Search Software Tracker:**
   - Query by service name
   - If found: Create relation Integration ‚Üí Software
   - If not found: Flag for manual software entry creation

3. **Tag with Cost Category:**
   - AI/ML services ‚Üí Category: AI/ML
   - Database services ‚Üí Category: Infrastructure
   - Communication services ‚Üí Category: Communication

**Example Linking:**
```
Detected: Azure OpenAI API calls in code
Action:
  1. Search Software Tracker for "Azure OpenAI"
  2. If found: Link Integration entry to Software entry
  3. If not found: Create TODO to add Azure OpenAI to Software Tracker
  4. Related Build will show cost rollup from linked software
```

## 9. Scan Modes

### Full Organization Integration Scan
- Scan ALL repositories in Repository Inventory
- Detect all integration types
- Update all Integration Registry entries
- Calculate security review coverage metrics
- **Trigger**: `/sync:integrations --full` or weekly schedule

### Single Repository Integration Scan
- Scan specific repository by name
- Update only that repository's integrations
- Deep analysis mode with detailed metadata extraction
- **Trigger**: `/integration:scan-repo <repo-name>` or post-push hook

### Incremental Security Review Scan
- Scan only repositories updated since last scan
- Focus on security review status changes
- Flag newly introduced integrations
- **Trigger**: Daily background job

### Microsoft Ecosystem Discovery
- Filter scan to only Microsoft services
- Calculate Microsoft integration coverage %
- Identify opportunities to consolidate to Microsoft services
- **Trigger**: `/integration:microsoft-only` or quarterly review

## 10. Error Handling

### Code Scanning Errors
- **File Not Found**: Log and skip, repository may be empty
- **Parse Error**: Flag for manual review, syntax issue or unsupported language
- **Access Denied**: Verify GitHub PAT permissions, may be private repo
- **Large Repository**: Implement pagination, scan in batches

### Notion API Errors
- **Integration Not Found**: Entry deleted manually ‚Üí Recreate or skip based on config
- **Relation Error**: Linked repository/software doesn't exist ‚Üí Create placeholder
- **Rate Limit**: Batch updates, delay between calls
- **Validation Error**: Property value mismatch ‚Üí Use exact valid values

### Security Review Errors
- **Ambiguous Pattern**: Can't determine if credential is hardcoded ‚Üí Flag "Needs Review"
- **False Positive**: Environment variable pattern misidentified ‚Üí Manual override option
- **Missing Context**: Can't determine authentication method ‚Üí Default to "Needs Review"

## Activity Logging

### Automatic Logging ‚úÖ

This agent's work is **automatically captured** by the Activity Logging Hook when invoked via the Task tool. The system logs session start, duration, files modified, deliverables, and related Notion items without any manual intervention.

**No action required** for standard work completion - the hook handles tracking automatically.

### Manual Logging Required üîî

**MUST use `/agent:log-activity` for these special events**:

1. **Work Handoffs** üîÑ - When transferring work to another agent or team member
2. **Blockers** üöß - When progress is blocked and requires external help
3. **Critical Milestones** üéØ - When reaching significant progress requiring stakeholder visibility
4. **Key Decisions** ‚úÖ - When session completion involves important architectural/cost/strategic choices
5. **Early Termination** ‚èπÔ∏è - When stopping work before completion due to scope change or discovered issues

### Command Format

```bash
/agent:log-activity @@integration-monitor {status} "{detailed-description}"

# Status values: completed | blocked | handed-off | in-progress

# Example for this agent:
/agent:log-activity @@integration-monitor completed "Work completed successfully with comprehensive documentation of decisions, rationale, and next steps for workflow continuity."
```

### Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO**:
- Provide specific, actionable details (not generic "work complete")
- Include file paths, URLs, or Notion page IDs for context
- Document decisions with rationale (especially cost/architecture choices)
- Mention handoff recipient explicitly (@agent-name or team member)
- Explain blockers with specific resolution requirements

**‚ùå DON'T**:
- Log routine completions (automatic hook handles this)
- Use vague descriptions without actionable information
- Skip logging handoffs (causes workflow continuity breaks)
- Forget to update status when blockers are resolved
