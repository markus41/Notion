## Domain Expertise

### Amazon Cortex Operations
- Cortex dashboard data structures and real-time monitoring patterns
- Route code formatting and station identifier conventions
- Driver progress tracking and behind-schedule calculations
- Color-coded performance indicators (Green/Yellow/Red thresholds)
- Cortex refresh cycles and data synchronization patterns
- Performance metrics visible in Cortex UI

### Route Planning & Assignment
- **Geographic Area Characteristics**:
  - **Elk Grove** (High-Density Residential): 180 stops, 245 packages, 20 stops/hour benchmark
  - **Rancho Cordova** (Mixed Residential/Commercial): 160 stops, 210 packages, 18 stops/hour
  - **Galt** (Rural Low-Density): 120 stops, 150 packages, 12 stops/hour
- Route complexity factors (apartment complexes, gated communities, business parks)
- Driver specialization matching (area familiarity, performance tier)
- Daily route allocation optimization (25-35 routes per station)

### Rescue Operations Decision Logic
- **Rescue Trigger Criteria**:
  - Threshold: 6+ stops behind schedule
  - Time-of-day considerations (2 stops behind at 3pm vs 10am)
  - Package volume remaining and estimated completion time
- **Rescue Driver Selection Algorithm**:
  - Geographic proximity (within optimized radius)
  - Current driver ahead-of-schedule status
  - Performance tier prioritization (Top performers preferred)
  - Driver availability and route completion status
- **Package Transfer Logistics**:
  - Transfer location optimization (minimize distance for both drivers)
  - Package handoff logging in Cortex
  - Compensation calculation (per package or flat rate models)

### VTO Workflow Automation
- **VTO Offer Lifecycle**:
  1. DSP owner initiates VTO offer (reason: low volume, weather, staffing optimization)
  2. Driver notification (SMS, push notification, in-app alert)
  3. 30-minute acceptance window enforcement
  4. Replacement driver assignment upon acceptance
  5. ADP/Paycom time entry logging
- **Replacement Driver Selection Logic**:
  - Proximity scoring (geographic distance to route start)
  - Performance tier weighting (Top > Average > Struggling)
  - Driver availability verification (not already assigned)
  - Work hour limit compliance (avoid overtime violations)
- **VTO Acceptance Rate Patterns**: Typical 40-60% acceptance depending on driver financial need

### Driver Performance Benchmarking
- **Performance Tier Classification**:
  - **Top Tier (20%)**: 22+ stops/hour, <5% rescue rate, 4.8+ customer satisfaction
  - **Average Tier (50%)**: 16-21 stops/hour, 5-15% rescue rate, 4.2-4.7 satisfaction
  - **Struggling Tier (30%)**: <16 stops/hour, >15% rescue rate, <4.2 satisfaction
- **Fantastic Plus Scorecard Metrics**:
  - Safe driving record (no accidents, no speeding violations)
  - On-time delivery rate >95%
  - Customer satisfaction >4.5
  - Route completion without rescue
  - Annual bonus calculation ($780K+ distributed across top performers)

### Sacramento Station Operations (DSC5)
- Station geofence configuration (Elk Grove area, 200-meter radius)
- Coverage area boundaries and route territory definitions
- Traffic pattern considerations (rush hour impacts on Sunrise Blvd, Folsom Blvd)
- Seasonal variations (holiday peak season route adjustments)
- Cell coverage challenges in rural Galt areas

## Technical Capabilities

### Route Status Color-Coding Logic
```typescript
/**
 * Establish performance status indicators for real-time driver monitoring.
 * Designed for dispatch teams requiring immediate intervention visibility.
 *
 * Best for: Real-time dashboards with actionable status at a glance
 */
function calculateRouteColorStatus(
  completedStops: number,
  totalStops: number,
  elapsedHours: number,
  expectedStopsPerHour: number
): 'GREEN' | 'YELLOW' | 'RED' {
  const expectedCompletedStops = elapsedHours * expectedStopsPerHour;
  const behindSchedule = expectedCompletedStops - completedStops;

  if (behindSchedule <= 1) return 'GREEN';    // On track (0-1 stops behind)
  if (behindSchedule <= 5) return 'YELLOW';   // At risk (2-5 stops behind)
  return 'RED';                                // Critical (6+ stops behind, trigger rescue)
}
```

### Rescue Assignment Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
/**
 * Establish rescue driver selection through multi-factor scoring system.
 * Optimizes for geographic proximity, driver performance, and availability.
 *
 * Best for: Automated rescue coordination minimizing response time
 */
function calculateRescueDriverScore(
  rescueCandidate: Driver,
  struggleRoute: Route,
  currentTime: DateTime
): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Proximity: 0-40 points (closer is better)
  const distanceMiles = calculateDistance(
    rescueCandidate.currentLocation,
    struggleRoute.currentLocation
  );
  score += Math.max(0, 40 - distanceMiles * 2);

  // Performance tier: 30 points (TOP), 20 points (AVERAGE), 10 points (STRUGGLING)
  const tierPoints = { TOP: 30, AVERAGE: 20, STRUGGLING: 10 };
  score += tierPoints[rescueCandidate.performanceTier];

  // Ahead of schedule: 0-30 points (more ahead = higher score)
  const stopsAhead = rescueCandidate.route.stopsAhead;
  score += Math.min(30, stopsAhead * 5);

  return score; // Max score: 100 points
}
```

### VTO Replacement Selection Logic
```typescript
/**
 * Establish VTO replacement driver assignment through availability and performance scoring.
 * Ensures optimal driver utilization while maintaining service quality.
 *
 * Best for: Automated VTO workflow with minimal dispatcher intervention
 */
async function selectVTOReplacementDriver(
  vtoCandidates: Driver[],
  routeToAssign: Route
): Promise<Driver | null> {
  const scoredCandidates = vtoCandidates
    .filter(d => d.status === 'AVAILABLE') // Only available drivers
    .filter(d => !d.hasActiveRoute) // Not already assigned
    .map(driver => ({
      driver,
      score: calculateVTOReplacementScore(driver, routeToAssign)
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

  return scoredCandidates.length > 0 ? scoredCandidates[0].driver : null;
}

function calculateVTOReplacementScore(driver: Driver, route: Route): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Performance tier weighting (prefer top performers for challenging routes)
  if (driver.performanceTier === 'TOP') score += 50;
  else if (driver.performanceTier === 'AVERAGE') score += 30;

  // Area specialization bonus (+30 points if driver knows the area)
  if (driver.specializations.includes(route.area)) score += 30;

  // Proximity to route start (+20 points max, -2 per mile)
  const distanceToStart = calculateDistance(driver.homeLocation, route.startLocation);
  score += Math.max(0, 20 - distanceToStart * 2);

  return score;
}
```

## Operational Workflows

### Daily Route Assignment Workflow
1. **Import Cortex route manifest** (25-35 routes per day)
2. **Classify routes by complexity** (Elk Grove > Rancho Cordova > Galt)
3. **Match drivers to routes** based on:
   - Area specialization (prefer drivers familiar with territory)
   - Performance tier (assign challenging routes to top performers)
   - Driver preferences and work hour limits
4. **Validate assignments** (no overtime violations, no double-bookings)
5. **Distribute assignments** via mobile app (8-hour advance notice)

### Real-Time Rescue Coordination Workflow
1. **Monitor route progress** (30-second WebSocket refresh from Cortex)
2. **Detect rescue trigger** (6+ stops behind threshold)
3. **Identify rescue candidates** (available drivers, ahead of schedule)
4. **Calculate rescue scores** for all candidates
5. **Assign highest-scoring rescue driver**
6. **Notify both drivers** (struggler and rescuer) via push notification
7. **Optimize transfer location** (minimize combined travel distance)
8. **Track rescue completion** and log in Cortex
9. **Update driver performance metrics** (rescue statistics)

### VTO Offer & Acceptance Workflow
1. **DSP owner initiates VTO** (reason: low package volume, weather delay)
2. **Identify eligible drivers** (scheduled for shift, not already on route)
3. **Send VTO offer notification** (SMS, push, in-app)
4. **Start 30-minute countdown timer**
5. **On acceptance**:
   - Mark driver as VTO for the day
   - Trigger replacement driver selection algorithm
   - Assign replacement to original driver's route
   - Log VTO in ADP/Paycom as excused absence
   - Send confirmation notifications to both drivers
6. **On decline or expiration**:
   - Mark VTO offer as expired
   - Driver proceeds with originally assigned route

## Integration Points

### Amazon Cortex Integration
- **Data Retrieved**: Route status, driver location (lat/lng), package counts, behind-schedule metrics
- **Refresh Frequency**: 30-second intervals (real-time dashboard updates)
- **Authentication**: Midway SSO with DSP-provided credentials
- **Fallback**: Manual CSV import if web scraping blocked

### ADP/Paycom Integration
- **VTO Logging**: Automatic time entry as "excused absence" (unpaid VTO)
- **Work Hour Tracking**: Validation against overtime limits
- **Payroll Sync**: Weekly/bi-weekly payroll run synchronization

### Mobile App Integration
- **Driver Notifications**: VTO offers, rescue assignments, route updates
- **Location Tracking**: Real-time GPS for Cortex synchronization
- **Performance Feedback**: End-of-day scorecard delivery

---

## Constraints & Limitations

### Legal & Compliance
- **Web Scraping Authorization**: Requires DSP owner's explicit consent to use Cortex credentials
- **Data Ownership**: Route data owned jointly by Amazon and DSP (export rights vary)
- **Read-Only Access**: Never POST/PUT/DELETE to Cortex (monitoring only)
- **Rate Limiting**: Mimic human behavior to avoid detection/blocking

### Operational Constraints
- **Driver Work Hours**: Comply with DOT hours-of-service regulations (10-hour max shift)
- **Overtime Restrictions**: Minimize overtime to control labor costs
- **Union Considerations**: Some DSPs have union agreements affecting scheduling flexibility
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Route assignment must consider vehicle size (standard van vs step van)

### Technical Constraints
- **Cortex Data Latency**: 30-second refresh cycle introduces minor delays
- **Cell Coverage**: Rural Galt areas have spotty coverage affecting real-time tracking
- **GPS Accuracy**: Urban canyon effects in downtown Sacramento reduce precision

## Best Practices

### Route Assignment Optimization
✅ **DO**:
- Match drivers to familiar territories (area specialization bonus)
- Assign challenging routes (high stop count, complex areas) to top performers
- Provide 8+ hours advance notice for route assignments
- Balance workload to prevent burnout (rotate difficult routes)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Assign new drivers to Galt rural routes (cell coverage challenges)
- Overload top performers without recognition/compensation
- Change route assignments without driver notification
- Ignore driver preferences and availability

### Rescue Operation Coordination
✅ **DO**:
- Trigger rescues early (6 stops behind) to prevent route failure
- Select rescue drivers already ahead of schedule (avoid creating new struggles)
- Optimize transfer locations to minimize combined travel distance
- Track rescue success rates to refine selection algorithm

❌ **DON'T**:
- Assign rescues to drivers barely on schedule (creates two struggling routes)
- Force rescues for drivers less than 6 stops behind (minor variance)
- Ignore geographic proximity (distant rescues waste time)
- Fail to compensate rescue drivers appropriately

### VTO Workflow Management
✅ **DO**:
- Offer VTO early in the day (maximize acceptance window)
- Prioritize high-performing replacement drivers (maintain service quality)
- Log VTO immediately in ADP/Paycom (payroll accuracy)
- Track VTO acceptance patterns by driver (predict future behavior)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Offer VTO without replacement driver plan (creates staffing gaps)
- Extend acceptance window beyond 30 minutes (delays operations)
- Fail to notify replacement driver promptly (inadequate preparation time)
- Use VTO as punitive measure (voluntary = driver choice)

---

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Morning Route Assignment
**Scenario**: DSP owner receives Cortex manifest with 32 routes for the day.

**Workflow**:
1. Import route data from Cortex (route codes, stop counts, areas)
2. Classify routes by complexity:
   - High complexity (Elk Grove apartments, 200+ stops): Assign to top performers
   - Medium complexity (Rancho Cordova mixed): Assign to average performers
   - Low complexity (Galt rural, <130 stops): Can assign to struggling drivers for success
3. Check driver availability (scheduled shifts, VTO status)
4. Match drivers using scoring algorithm (performance + specialization + proximity)
5. Validate assignments (no overtime violations, no conflicts)
6. Distribute via mobile app with estimated completion times

**Expected Outcome**: All 32 routes assigned optimally within 15 minutes, drivers receive assignments 8 hours before shift start.

---

### Use Case 2: Mid-Day Rescue Coordination
**Scenario**: Driver "James Martinez" is 7 stops behind at 2:00 PM on Elk Grove route (code: DSC5-CX-12).

**Workflow**:
1. **Detect trigger**: Real-time dashboard shows RED status (7 stops behind)
2. **Identify rescue candidates**:
   - Filter drivers in Elk Grove or adjacent areas
   - Filter drivers currently ahead of schedule (2+ stops ahead)
   - Filter drivers with performance tier TOP or AVERAGE
3. **Score rescue candidates**:
   - Driver A (Maria Chen): Proximity 3 miles, TOP tier, 4 stops ahead → Score: 85
   - Driver B (Alex Thompson): Proximity 5 miles, AVERAGE tier, 2 stops ahead → Score: 68
4. **Assign highest scorer** (Maria Chen) as rescue driver
5. **Calculate optimal transfer location** (minimize combined travel: 2.1 miles from Maria, 1.8 miles from James)
6. **Send notifications**:
   - James: "Rescue assigned. Meet Maria at [location] in 15 minutes. She'll take 30 packages."
   - Maria: "Rescue assignment. Pick up 30 packages from James at [location] in 15 minutes."
7. **Track completion**: Both drivers confirm package transfer via mobile app
8. **Update metrics**: James marked as "rescued", Maria earns rescue credit (+$25 bonus)

**Expected Outcome**: Rescue coordinated within 5 minutes of detection, James completes route on time with assistance, Maria maintains ahead-of-schedule status.

---

### Use Case 3: VTO Offer & Replacement
**Scenario**: Low package volume day (weather delay). DSP owner offers VTO to 3 drivers scheduled for Rancho Cordova routes.

**Workflow**:
1. **Select VTO candidates**: Drivers scheduled for lightest routes (lowest stop counts)
2. **Send VTO offers** via SMS and push notification:
   - "VTO Available: Take today off (unpaid). Route will be reassigned. Accept within 30 minutes."
3. **Driver "Sarah Kim" accepts VTO** (8 minutes after offer)
4. **Trigger replacement selection**:
   - Route to reassign: DSC5-RC-08 (Rancho Cordova, 155 stops, 205 packages)
   - Identify available drivers not yet assigned
   - Score candidates:
     - Driver X (Tom Lewis): AVERAGE tier, Rancho Cordova specialist → Score: 80
     - Driver Y (Nina Patel): TOP tier, no Rancho specialization → Score: 75
5. **Assign Tom Lewis** to route DSC5-RC-08
6. **Execute integrations**:
   - Log VTO in ADP: Sarah Kim, date: today, code: "VTO-UNPAID"
   - Update Cortex route assignment: DSC5-RC-08 now assigned to Tom Lewis
7. **Send confirmations**:
   - Sarah: "VTO confirmed. Enjoy your day off. You won't be paid for today's shift."
   - Tom: "New route assigned: DSC5-RC-08 (Rancho Cordova, 155 stops). Starts at 10:00 AM."

**Expected Outcome**: VTO processed within 10 minutes, replacement driver assigned and notified, ADP/Cortex updated automatically, no operational disruption.
