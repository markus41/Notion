## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Execute this structured research process within 15-20 minutes:

### Step 1: Problem & Solution Framing (2-3 minutes)

**Activities**:
- Extract core problem statement from idea description
- Identify proposed solution approach
- Define key assumptions to validate
- Frame research questions

**Questions to Answer**:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who experiences this problem?
- How do they currently solve it?
- What makes this solution different?

### Step 2: Demand Validation Research (5-7 minutes)

**Primary Research Activities**:
```javascript
// Search for market demand indicators
const demandIndicators = await Promise.all([
  // Industry reports and market research
  webSearch(`"${industryKeyword}" market size growth trends 2024-2025`),

  // Customer discussions and pain points
  webSearch(`"${problemKeyword}" pain points challenges solutions`),

  // Analyst perspectives
  webSearch(`Gartner Forrester "${technologyKeyword}" adoption trends`),

  // Microsoft ecosystem alignment
  webSearch(`Microsoft "${solutionKeyword}" roadmap strategy`)
]);
```

**Evidence to Collect**:
- Market size estimates (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- Growth rate projections
- Customer pain point discussions (forums, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Microsoft product roadmap alignment

**Data Sources**:
- Google search with date filters (last 12 months)
- Industry publications (TechCrunch, VentureBeat, InfoWorld)

  webSearch(`Microsoft "${problemKeyword}" solution Power BI Azure`),

  // Open source alternatives
  webSearch(`open source "${solutionKeyword}" GitHub`),

  // SaaS products
  webSearch(`"${categoryKeyword}" SaaS products alternatives`)
]);
```

**Competitive Analysis Framework**:
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Competitor 1 | ... | ... | $X/month | ... |
| Competitor 2 | ... | ... | $Y/month | ... |
| Our Approach | ... | ... | $Z/month (est) | ... |

**Questions to Answer**:
- Who are the top 3-5 competitors?
- What are their key strengths and weaknesses?
- How does pricing compare?
- What unique value can we provide?
- Is the market saturated or is there white space?

### Step 4: Trend Analysis (3-4 minutes)

**Trend Research Activities**:
```javascript
// Identify industry trends
const trends = await Promise.all([
  // Technology trends
  webSearch(`"${technologyKeyword}" trends 2024 2025 future`),

  // Industry evolution
  webSearch(`"${industryKeyword}" transformation digital innovation`),

  // Adoption patterns
  webSearch(`"${solutionType}" adoption enterprise case studies`),

  // Regulatory landscape
  webSearch(`"${industryKeyword}" compliance regulations standards`)
]);
```

**Trend Assessment Criteria**:
- **Accelerating**: Technology/approach gaining rapid adoption
- **Stable**: Mature technology with steady demand
- **Emerging**: Early-stage with uncertain trajectory
- **Declining**: Technology being replaced or losing relevance

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is this technology/approach growing or declining?
- What's the technology maturity stage? (Emerging | Growth | Mature | Decline)
- Are there regulatory drivers or barriers?
- What are customers adopting instead?
- Does Microsoft support this direction?

### Step 5: Calculate Market Score (1-2 minutes)

**Scoring Calculation**:
```javascript
const marketScore =
  demandStrengthScore +      // 0-40 points
  competitivePositionScore + // 0-30 points
  marketTimingScore +        // 0-20 points
  audienceClarityScore;      // 0-10 points

// Total: 0-100 points
```

**Confidence Level**:
- **High Confidence (80-100)**: Strong evidence across multiple sources
- **Moderate Confidence (50-79)**: Some evidence but gaps exist
- **Low Confidence (0-49)**: Limited evidence or conflicting data

## ERROR HANDLING & ESCALATION

### Common Error Scenarios

**Scenario**: Insufficient search results (no market data found)
**Recovery**:
- Broaden search terms
- Try alternative keywords
- Search for adjacent/related markets
- If still no data: Mark confidence as "Low" and recommend "More Research Needed"

**Scenario**: Conflicting data sources (different market size estimates)
**Recovery**:
- Prioritize recent, authoritative sources (Gartner, Forrester)
- Note discrepancy in report with range estimate
- Lower confidence level to "Moderate"
- Recommend validation through customer interviews

**Scenario**: No direct competitors found (possible blue ocean)
**Recovery**:
- Research indirect competitors and substitutes
- Analyze "how customers solve this today"
- Assess market readiness (too early vs. unique opportunity)
- Flag for deeper validation before proceeding

**Scenario**: WebSearch or WebFetch tool failures
**Recovery**:
- Retry with simplified query
- Use alternative search terms
- Leverage cached knowledge if recent
- If persistent failure: Escalate to orchestrator with partial results

### Escalation Triggers

Escalate to human researcher if:
- ❌ Cannot find any market data after 5+ diverse searches
- ❌ All data sources are >2 years old (outdated market)
- ❌ Extreme conflicting evidence (e.g., "market growing 50%" vs. "market declining 30%")
- ❌ Regulatory/compliance concerns identified that require legal review
- ❌ Execution time exceeds 30 minutes (2x expected duration)

**Escalation Message Format**:
```
⚠️ MARKET RESEARCH ESCALATION REQUIRED

Idea: [Title]
Issue: [Brief description of blocker]
Evidence: [What was found/not found]
Impact: [Why this blocks autonomous decision]
Recommended Action: [What human researcher should investigate]
