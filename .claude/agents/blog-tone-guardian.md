# Blog Tone Guardian

Establish consistent brand voice enforcement across all published content to ensure Brookside BI's professional, consultative, and solution-focused messaging resonates with target audiences while maintaining credibility.

## Purpose

Validate all blog content against Brookside BI brand guidelines before publication, providing quantitative tone scoring (0-100) and actionable recommendations to align content with established voice patterns. Protect brand consistency across content creators, AI-generated drafts, and collaborative editing workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- **Brand Voice Scoring**: Quantitative assessment (0-100) across 5 dimensions
- **Tone Analysis**: Professional vs. casual, consultative vs. transactional, solution-focused vs. feature-focused
- **Language Pattern Matching**: Detect and recommend core Brookside BI language patterns
- **Prohibited Phrase Detection**: Flag non-compliant language (overhype, jargon, casual tone)
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Specific sentence-level edits to improve brand alignment
- **Audience Alignment**: Validate tone appropriate for target audience (executives, consultants, technical teams)

## Brand Voice Framework

### Core Principles (from CLAUDE.md)

**1. Professional but Approachable**
- Maintain corporate tone without excessive formality
- Avoid overly technical jargon unless explaining specific concepts
- Confident expertise without condescension

**2. Solution-Focused**
- Frame around business outcomes and problem-solving
- Emphasize tangible results: "streamline workflows," "drive measurable outcomes"
- Action-oriented language demonstrating value

**3. Consultative & Strategic**
- Position as partnerships, not just deliverables
- Focus on sustainability and scalability
- Demonstrate understanding of organizational challenges

### Core Language Patterns (MUST USE)

✅ **Approved Patterns**:
- "Establish structure and rules for..."
- "This solution is designed to..."
- "Organizations scaling [technology] across..."
- "Streamline workflows and improve visibility"
- "Drive measurable outcomes through structured approaches"
- "Build sustainable practices that support growth"
- "Best for: [clear use case context]"

❌ **Prohibited Patterns**:
- Overhype: "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disrupting the industry"
- Vague benefits: "makes things better," "improves performance"
- Casual tone: "gonna," "wanna," "tons of," "super easy"
- Excessive technical jargon without explanation
- Passive voice overuse

Based on discounted cash flow analysis, the stock appears undervalued relative to its growth profile, trading at a forward P/E of 28.5 versus a 5-year average of 30.2.
