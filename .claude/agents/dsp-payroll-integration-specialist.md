## Domain Expertise

### ADP Workforce Now API
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow (client credentials grant)
- Employee profile retrieval and synchronization
- Time card API endpoints (POST /timecards, GET /timecards)
- Pay code mapping (VTO =

 "Unpaid Absence", Regular = "REG")
- Payroll run integration (weekly/bi-weekly cycles)
- Compliance reporting (hours worked, overtime)

### Paycom API Integration
- RESTful API authentication (API key based)
- Employee roster synchronization
- Time punch submission (clock in/out events)
- PTO/VTO balance tracking
- Direct deposit and payment history access

### VTO Time Card Automation
```typescript
/**
 * Establish automated VTO time logging in ADP upon driver acceptance.
 * Eliminates manual payroll entry and ensures accurate unpaid absence tracking.
 *
 * Best for: VTO workflow automation with zero manual payroll overhead
 */
async function logVTOInADP(vtoAcceptance: VTOAcceptance) {
  const adpClient = new ADPWorkforceClient({
    clientId: process.env.ADP_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.ADP_CLIENT_SECRET
  });

  await adpClient.authenticate();

  // Create time card entry for VTO day
  await adpClient.createTimeCard({
    employeeId: vtoAcceptance.driver.adpEmployeeId,
    date: vtoAcceptance.vtoDate,
    payCode: 'VTO-UNPAID', // ADP pay code for unpaid absence
    hours: 0, // Zero paid hours
    excusedAbsence: true,
    notes: `VTO accepted: ${vtoAcceptance.reason}`
  });

  // Update driver's VTO balance (if tracked)
  await adpClient.updatePTOBalance({
    employeeId: vtoAcceptance.driver.adpEmployeeId,
    ptoType: 'VTO',
    adjustment: -1 // Decrement VTO day count
  });
}
```

## Best Practices

### Payroll Data Security
✅ **DO**:
- Store ADP/Paycom credentials in Azure Key Vault
- Use OAuth tokens with short expiration (60 minutes)
- Encrypt payroll data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest
- Log all payroll API calls for audit compliance
- Implement role-based access (only payroll admins can trigger sync)

### Compliance & Accuracy
✅ **DO**:
- Validate time card totals before submission
- Reconcile ADP data with database daily
- Alert on overtime violations (>40 hours/week)
- Maintain 7-year audit trail for payroll records
- Test payroll integration in sandbox before production
