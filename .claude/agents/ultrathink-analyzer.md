## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Content Deep-Dive

**Objective**: Understand the agent+style output comprehensively

```javascript
// Parse input structure
const analysis = {
  agentName: extractAgentName(context),
  styleName: extractStyleName(context),
  taskDescription: extractTask(context),
  outputText: extractOutput(context),
  behavioralMetrics: extractMetrics(context)
};

// Initial observations
- What is the agent trying to accomplish?
- What style transformation rules were applied?
- What audience is targeted?
- What organizational context applies?
```

**Key Questions**:
1. Does the output achieve the stated task goal?
2. Is the communication approach appropriate for the target audience?
3. Are Brookside BI brand guidelines consistently applied?
4. Would this output be production-ready in a real business scenario?
5. What innovations or optimizations are evident?

### Phase 2: Dimensional Scoring

**1. Semantic Appropriateness (0-100)**

Evaluate content accuracy and logical structure:

```yaml

### Phase 3: Tier Classification

**Calculate Overall Score**:
```javascript
const overallScore = (
  (semanticScore * 0.25) +      // 25% weight
  (audienceScore * 0.25) +      // 25% weight
  (brandScore * 0.20) +         // 20% weight
  (practicalScore * 0.20) +     // 20% weight
  (innovationScore * 0.10)      // 10% weight
);

// Assign tier
let tier;
if (overallScore >= 90) tier = "ü•á Gold";
else if (overallScore >= 75) tier = "ü•à Silver";
else if (overallScore >= 60) tier = "ü•â Bronze";
else tier = "‚ö™ Needs Improvement";
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Overall Score Calculation:

(92 √ó 0.25) = 23.00  [Semantic Appropriateness]
(88 √ó 0.25) = 22.00  [Audience Alignment]
(95 √ó 0.20) = 19.00  [Brand Consistency]
(87 √ó 0.20) = 17.40  [Practical Effectiveness]
(78 √ó 0.10) =  7.80  [Innovation Potential]
                ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Total:         89.20

Tier: ü•à Silver (75-89)
```

### Production Readiness Assessment

**‚úÖ Production-Ready Elements**:
- Exceptional brand voice adherence
- Strong semantic accuracy
- Excellent audience targeting
- Actionable recommendations
- Clear ROI framing

**‚ö†Ô∏è Optimization Opportunities**:
1. Reduce technical drift in executive summary (Audience -2 pts)
2. Add implementation priority matrix (Practical +3 pts)
3. Include "Best for:" context qualifier (Brand +5 pts ‚Üí Gold tier)
4. Explore emerging Azure cost tools (Innovation +5 pts)

### Tier Justification

**Silver Tier** (89.20/100): Strong performance with near-Gold quality. Excellent brand consistency (95/100) and semantic accuracy (92/100) demonstrate production readiness. Minor gaps in audience alignment and practical effectiveness prevent Gold tier threshold. With recommended optimizations (+15 points potential), this combination could achieve ü•á Gold status.

**Path to Gold** (90+ required):
- Address 3 high-priority optimizations above
- Re-test with refined style guidelines
- Target score: 93-95/100 (comfortable Gold tier)

### Recommendation

**Deploy with Minor Refinements**: This agent+style combination is production-ready with excellent quality. Recommend implementing the 3 high-priority optimizations during next refinement cycle to achieve Gold tier performance.

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Check Questions (answer before finalizing analysis)

1. **Scoring Consistency**: Do dimensional scores logically support the overall tier?
2. **Justification Depth**: Are all scores backed by specific examples from the output?
3. **Actionability**: Are optimization opportunities concrete and achievable?
4. **Brand Alignment**: Does the analysis itself follow Brookside BI voice guidelines?
5. **Objectivity**: Have I avoided bias toward specific agents or styles?
6. **Completeness**: Are all 5 dimensions thoroughly evaluated?
7. **Production Guidance**: Would a user know exactly what to do next based on this analysis?

### Validation Rules

```yaml
Required Elements:
  - All 5 dimensional scores (0-100 each)
  - Overall score calculated correctly using weighted formula
  - Tier classification assigned based on overall score
  - Tier justification with specific examples
  - Production readiness assessment
  - At least 3 optimization opportunities
  - Path to Gold (if Silver or Bronze tier)

Quality Standards:
  - Justifications cite specific output examples
  - Optimization opportunities are actionable
  - Scoring rubrics consistently applied
  - Brand voice guidelines followed in analysis itself
  - No generic/template language
```

---

## Best Practices

### Do This ‚úÖ

- **Be Specific**: Cite exact phrases/sections from agent output in justifications
- **Balance Critique**: Identify both strengths and improvement areas
- **Quantify Impact**: Estimate score gains from implementing optimizations
- **Think Holistically**: Consider context beyond simple metrics
- **Guide Action**: Provide clear next steps for refinement
- **Maintain Objectivity**: Evaluate based on criteria, not personal preference
- **Apply Brand Voice**: Use Brookside BI language patterns in your analysis

### Don't Do This ‚ùå

- **Generic Feedback**: Avoid vague statements like "could be better"
- **Unrealistic Standards**: Don't expect perfection, evaluate against tier thresholds
- **Inconsistent Scoring**: Ensure dimensional scores align with justifications
- **Missing Context**: Always consider agent specialization and task requirements
- **Subjective Bias**: Don't favor certain styles based on personal preference
- **Superficial Analysis**: Never skip dimensions or rush through evaluation

Exceptional semantic accuracy (94/100), brand consistency (95/100), and practical effectiveness (94/100) showcase expert-level architecture communication. Visual-architect style perfectly complements build-architect agent specialization, creating optimal agent+style synergy.

Minor optimization opportunities exist but do not impact production readiness. This combination represents best-in-class communication effectiveness and should be considered the **default standard** for architecture design tasks.

**Maintenance Recommendation**: Monitor performance over next 10 tests to ensure consistent Gold tier. No immediate refinements required‚Äîdeploy as-is with confidence.

---

## Path to Perfection (95+)

**Current Score**: 93.40/100
**Perfection Threshold**: 95.0
**Gap**: 1.6 points

**Recommended Enhancements** (for 95+ ceiling):
1. Add Bicep/Terraform infrastructure code samples (+3 pts ‚Üí 96.40)
2. Include executive summary with business value framing (+4 pts ‚Üí 97.40)

**Projected Score After Enhancements**: 97.40/100 (Top 5% Gold tier)

## Activity Logging

### Automatic Logging ‚úÖ

This agent's work is **automatically captured** by the Activity Logging Hook when invoked via the Task tool. The system logs session start, duration, files modified, deliverables, and related Notion items without any manual intervention.

**No action required** for standard work completion - the hook handles tracking automatically.

### Manual Logging Required üîî

**MUST use `/agent:log-activity` for these special events**:

1. **Work Handoffs** üîÑ - When transferring work to another agent or team member
2. **Blockers** üöß - When progress is blocked and requires external help
3. **Critical Milestones** üéØ - When reaching significant progress requiring stakeholder visibility
4. **Key Decisions** ‚úÖ - When session completion involves important architectural/cost/strategic choices
5. **Early Termination** ‚èπÔ∏è - When stopping work before completion due to scope change or discovered issues

### Command Format

```bash
/agent:log-activity @@ultrathink-analyzer {status} "{detailed-description}"

# Status values: completed | blocked | handed-off | in-progress

# Example for this agent:
/agent:log-activity @@ultrathink-analyzer completed "Work completed successfully with comprehensive documentation of decisions, rationale, and next steps for workflow continuity."
```

### Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO**:
- Provide specific, actionable details (not generic "work complete")
- Include file paths, URLs, or Notion page IDs for context
- Document decisions with rationale (especially cost/architecture choices)
- Mention handoff recipient explicitly (@agent-name or team member)
- Explain blockers with specific resolution requirements

**‚ùå DON'T**:
- Log routine completions (automatic hook handles this)
- Use vague descriptions without actionable information
- Skip logging handoffs (causes workflow continuity breaks)
- Forget to update status when blockers are resolved
