- Bootstrap completion summary with category breakdown
- Dry-run preview showing proposed changes
- Category-specific update results
- Full refresh confirmation

**Use Cases Highlighted**:
- Quarterly command audits
- After adding new command categories
- Post-repository updates
- Metadata synchronization validation

#### Renumbered Existing Examples:

- Example 2: Chained Command Workflow (formerly Example 1)
- Example 4: Cost Optimization Workflow (formerly Example 2)

### 3. Updated Command Reference Quick Guide (Lines 1594-1613)

**New Entries Added**:

| Command | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `/cost:cost-impact` | Budget impact analysis | [ADD\|REMOVE] [tool] [cost] |
| `/cost:monthly-spend` | Quick total monthly spend | - |
| `/cost:annual-projection` | Yearly forecast calculation | - |
| `/cost:microsoft-alternatives` | M365/Azure replacement options | [tool-name] |
| `/action:register-all` | Sync command inventory to Notion | [--dry-run] [--category] |

**Table Now Includes**: 15 commands (increased from 10)
