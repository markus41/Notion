# Notion Database ID Configuration Guide

## Authentication Required

The Notion MCP server requires authentication before database IDs can be queried.

### Authentication Steps

1. **Authenticate Notion MCP**:
   ```bash
   # The Notion MCP is configured in .claude.json but needs authentication
   # Follow the authentication prompts when running Notion commands
   ```

2. **Verify Authentication**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   # Should show: notion: ‚úì Connected
   ```

## After Authentication - Database ID Discovery

Once Notion MCP is authenticated, run these commands to discover database IDs:

```bash
# Search for each database by name
# Ideas Registry
notion-search "Ideas Registry" --database

# Research Hub
notion-search "Research Hub" --database

# Example Builds
notion-search "Example Builds" --database

# Software & Cost Tracker
notion-search "Software Tracker" --database

# Knowledge Vault
notion-search "Knowledge Vault" --database

# Integration Registry
notion-search "Integration Registry" --database

# OKRs & Strategic Initiatives
notion-search "OKRs" --database
```

## Updating Commands with Database IDs

Once database IDs are discovered, update all slash commands in `.claude/commands/` that reference Notion databases:

### Example Update Pattern

**Before:**
```markdown
Query Notion Ideas Registry database
```

**After:**
```markdown
Query Notion database: ${NOTION_DATABASE_ID_IDEAS}
# Or hardcode the UUID if environment variables aren't supported:
# Database ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

### Commands Requiring Database ID Updates

**Cost Commands (12 files):**
- monthly-spend.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- annual-projection.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- cost-by-category.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- unused-software.md ‚Üí Software Tracker + Ideas/Research/Builds (for relation counting)
- consolidation-opportunities.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- expiring-contracts.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- build-costs.md ‚Üí Example Builds + Software Tracker
- research-costs.md ‚Üí Research Hub + Software Tracker
- what-if-analysis.md ‚Üí Software Tracker + Ideas/Research/Builds
- cost-impact.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- microsoft-alternatives.md ‚Üí Software Tracker

**Innovation Commands (5 files):**
- innovation/new-idea.md ‚Üí Ideas Registry + Software Tracker
- innovation/start-research.md ‚Üí Research Hub + Ideas Registry + Software Tracker
- cost/analyze.md ‚Üí Software Tracker
- knowledge/archive.md ‚Üí All databases (for archival workflow)
- team/assign.md ‚Üí Ideas/Research/Builds (for assignment)

## Configuration File Update

Update the CLAUDE.md environment section:

```bash
# Database IDs (populate after authentication)
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_IDEAS=<UUID from discovery>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_RESEARCH=<UUID from discovery>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_BUILDS=<UUID from discovery>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_SOFTWARE=<UUID from discovery>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_KNOWLEDGE=<UUID from discovery>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_INTEGRATIONS=<UUID from discovery>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_OKRS=<UUID from discovery>
```

## Verification Checklist

After populating database IDs:

- [ ] All 17 existing commands reference correct database IDs
- [ ] Test query against Ideas Registry returns results
- [ ] Test query against Software Tracker returns cost data
- [ ] Test relation counting between databases works
- [ ] Verify rollup calculations (Estimated Cost, Total Cost) function properly
- [ ] Confirm all 7 databases are accessible via Notion MCP
- [ ] Update .claude/.env (if exists) with database ID environment variables

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Comments**: When hardcoding UUIDs, add comments explaining which database
   ```markdown
   # Database ID: 123e4567... (üí° Ideas Registry)
   ```

2. **Centralize Configuration**: Consider creating a shared configuration file
   ```markdown
   # .claude/notion-config.md
   - IDEAS_DB: 123e4567...
   - RESEARCH_DB: 234e5678...
   [etc.]
   ```

3. **Test Before Deployment**: Always test database queries in isolation before integrating into commands

4. **Document Relations**: Keep this file updated as database structure evolves

**Next Steps**:
1. Authenticate Notion MCP
2. Discover database IDs using search commands
3. Update this document with actual UUIDs
4. Update all slash commands with database IDs
5. Test each command with real Notion data
6. Mark authentication task as complete
