# /microsoft-alternatives - Microsoft Ecosystem Alternative Analysis

Research Microsoft ecosystem alternatives for third-party tools to drive cost optimization, improve integration, and align with Microsoft-first strategy through comprehensive service comparison and migration feasibility assessment.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Identify target software (third-party tool to replace)
2. Query Software Tracker for current cost and usage details
3. Research Microsoft ecosystem for alternatives:
   - Azure services (compute, data, AI, security, etc.)
   - M365 suite (Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.)
   - Power Platform (Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps)
   - GitHub (if development-related)
   - Dynamics 365 (if business process-related)
4. For each Microsoft alternative:
   - Map features (parity check)
   - Calculate licensing cost
   - Assess integration benefits
   - Estimate migration complexity
   - Identify gaps or limitations
5. Calculate cost comparison (current vs Microsoft)
6. Assess strategic value beyond cost (SSO, compliance, integration)
7. Provide migration roadmap if recommended
8. Consider hybrid approaches (partial migration)
```
