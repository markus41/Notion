# /cost-impact - Quick Cost Impact Assessment for Changes

Instantly calculate the budget impact of proposed software additions, cancellations, or license changes to support rapid decision-making and maintain cost transparency.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Identify change type:
   - ADD: New software subscription
   - REMOVE: Cancel existing software
   - MODIFY: Change licenses or tier
   - CONVERT: Trial to Active conversion
2. For ADD/CONVERT:
   - Get proposed cost and license count
   - Calculate Total Monthly Cost (Cost √ó Licenses)
   - Calculate Annual Cost (Monthly √ó 12)
   - Check if Microsoft service
   - Identify category
   - Compare to similar existing tools (duplication check)
3. For REMOVE:
   - Get current Total Monthly Cost
   - Calculate savings (monthly and annual)
   - Check linked projects (impact assessment)
   - Identify replacement if needed
4. For MODIFY:
   - Calculate current cost
   - Calculate new cost
   - Calculate delta
5. Show immediate impact and cumulative effect on total spend
6. Flag risks and recommend decision
```
