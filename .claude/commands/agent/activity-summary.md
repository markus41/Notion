## What This Command Does

**Multi-Source Analysis:**

1. **Queries All 3 Tracking Tiers:**
   - Notion Database: "ü§ñ Agent Activity Hub" (primary source)
   - Markdown Log: `.claude/logs/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` (quick reference)
   - JSON State: `.claude/data/agent-state.json` (programmatic data)

2. **Aggregates Key Metrics:**
   - Total sessions (active, completed, blocked, handed-off)
   - Total work duration across all sessions
   - Files created and updated
   - Success rate and completion percentage
   - Average session duration
   - Agent utilization and workload distribution

3. **Identifies Workflow Health:**
   - Active sessions requiring attention
   - Blocked sessions with escalation needs
   - Pending handoffs in queue
   - Long-running sessions (>7 days active)
   - Completed sessions with impact metrics

## Integration with Innovation Nexus

**Cross-Database Insights:**

The summary automatically correlates agent activity with:

1. **Ideas Registry:**
   - Ideas championed by each agent
   - Ideas requiring research or builds
   - Viability assessments in progress

2. **Research Hub:**
   - Active research threads
   - Viability assessments completed
   - Research requiring builds

3. **Example Builds:**
   - Builds in development
   - Deployment status tracking
   - Cost tracking linked to builds

4. **Software & Cost Tracker:**
   - Tools used in sessions
   - Cost optimization progress
   - Savings identified

5. **Knowledge Vault:**
   - Documentation created
   - Learnings archived
   - Reusability assessments

**Example Cross-Database Summary:**
```
Innovation Pipeline Health:
  Ideas: 12 active (5 need research, 3 ready to build)
  Research: 4 active (2 highly viable, 1 needs more investigation)
  Builds: 6 active (3 deployed, 2 in development, 1 blocked)
  Knowledge: 8 new entries this week

Agent Contributions:
  Ideas captured: 12 (@ideas-capture: 8, @research-coordinator: 4)
  Research completed: 2 (@research-coordinator: 2)
  Builds delivered: 3 (@build-architect: 2, @integration-specialist: 1)

## Performance Benchmarks

**Typical Execution Times:**
- `today` with 1-5 sessions: <1 second
- `week` with 10-20 sessions: 1-2 seconds
- `month` with 50-100 sessions: 2-4 seconds
- `all` with 500+ sessions: 5-10 seconds

**Data Sources Queried:**
1. JSON (fastest): `.claude/data/agent-state.json`
2. Markdown (fast): `.claude/logs/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`
3. Notion (slower): API calls to Agent Activity Hub database

**Optimization**: Command prioritizes JSON for speed, falls back to Markdown, validates against Notion for accuracy.

## Technical Implementation

**Data Sources:**
- Primary: `.claude/data/agent-state.json` (programmatic)
- Secondary: `.claude/logs/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` (human-readable)
- Tertiary: Notion "ü§ñ Agent Activity Hub" (source of truth)

**Calculation Methods:**
- Duration: Sum of `completedAt - startedAt` for completed sessions
- Success Rate: `completedSessions / totalSessions √ó 100`
- Average Duration: `totalDuration / sessionCount`
- Workload Balance: Compare agent session count vs. mean

**Caching:**
- Today's data: No caching (always fresh)
- Week/month: 5-minute cache
- All-time: 15-minute cache
- Cache invalidated on new session logged

   Try: /agent:activity-summary month all
   ```

2. **Unknown agent:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent not found: @invalid-agent
   Available agents: @cost-analyst, @markdown-expert, @build-architect, ...
   ```

3. **Notion database unavailable:**
   ```
