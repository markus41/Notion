# /expiring-contracts - Contract Expiration Monitoring & Renewal Planning

Monitor upcoming contract expirations to enable proactive renewal decisions, prevent service disruptions, and identify renegotiation opportunities that drive cost optimization.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Query Software Tracker database
2. Filter WHERE Status = "Active" OR Status = "Trial"
3. For each entry with Contract End Date:
   - Calculate days until expiration: Contract End Date - Today
   - Categorize urgency:
     - URGENT: 0-30 days (immediate action required)
     - WARNING: 31-60 days (decision needed soon)
     - NOTICE: 61-90 days (planning window)
     - FUTURE: 91+ days (upcoming in next quarter)
4. For each expiring contract:
   - Get current monthly/annual cost
   - Count linked projects (usage assessment)
   - Identify owner/decision maker
   - Check for Microsoft alternatives
   - Note auto-renewal status (if tracked)
5. Sort by urgency, then by cost (highest first)
6. Calculate total renewal cost for each period
7. Identify optimization opportunities at renewal time
```
