# Compliance Audit

Comprehensive compliance assessment for software licensing, data privacy, and third-party security across the Innovation Nexus ecosystem.

## Purpose

Conduct systematic compliance review to ensure adherence to software licensing obligations, data privacy regulations, and security best practices. This command establishes audit-ready evidence collection and generates actionable remediation plans to protect Brookside BI from regulatory risk while supporting sustainable innovation growth.

**Best for**: Organizations managing diverse software portfolios with licensing complexity, regulatory obligations (GDPR, CCPA), and third-party integrations requiring security oversight.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

Uses **parallel compliance assessment pattern** where domain-specific compliance checks execute in parallel, then synthesize findings for cross-domain optimization.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Compliance Scoping (0-10 mins)
1. **compliance-orchestrator** - Determine applicable compliance frameworks
2. **@cost-analyst** - Query Software & Cost Tracker for all active software
3. **@integration-specialist** - Query Integration Registry for third-party tools
4. **@knowledge-curator** - Assess Knowledge Vault for sensitive data classification
5. **@database-architect** - Review Notion database access controls

**Data Sources**:
- Software & Cost Tracker (`13b5e9de-2dd1-45ec-839a-4f3d50cd8d06`)
- Integration Registry
- Knowledge Vault

9. **contract-monitor** - Check contract expiration dates (flag renewals within 60 days)
10. **usage-analyzer** - Identify unused software (no relations to Ideas/Research/Builds)

**License Types Audited**:
- **Open Source**: MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, AGPL (attribution requirements)
- **Commercial**: Per-user, per-device, enterprise (seat count compliance)
- **Freemium**: Usage limits, feature restrictions
- **Trial**: Time-limited licenses requiring conversion or cancellation
