## Command Lifecycle Visualization

The following diagram illustrates how slash commands progress from developer creation through team member execution, highlighting the role of frontmatter metadata and Notion Actions Registry integration for centralized command discovery.

**Sequence Diagram: Complete Command Lifecycle**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant File as Command File<br/>(.claude/commands/category/name.md)
    participant Claude as Claude Code

    end
```

*Figure 2: Slash command lifecycle showing creation, registration via `/action:register-all`, and execution phases. The Actions Registry serves as the centralized metadata repository enabling team-wide command discovery and semantic search capabilities.*

**Key Lifecycle Phases**:

1. **Creation Phase**: Developer creates `.md` file with YAML frontmatter containing business description, allowed tools, and parameter hints
2. **Registration Phase**: `/action:register-all` scans command files, parses metadata, and populates Notion Actions Registry database
3. **Discovery Phase**: Team members search registry for relevant commands using semantic search or browse by category
4. **Execution Phase**: Claude Code loads command file, parses parameters, executes workflow instructions, and returns results

**Business Value**: Establishes self-documenting command infrastructure that drives measurable improvements in team onboarding efficiency and eliminates manual documentation maintenance through automated synchronization workflows.

---

## Command Structure

Each command follows consistent patterns for predictable, reliable execution:

### Frontmatter
Commands include metadata that controls behavior:

```yaml
---
description: Business-focused summary (appears in /help)
allowed-tools: Tool1(pattern:*), Tool2(pattern:*)
argument-hint: [expected parameters]
model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
---
```

### Workflow Pattern
All commands follow this structure:

1. **Search existing content** - Prevent duplicates
2. **Fetch context** - Understand current state
3. **Execute operation** - Create/update with proper linking
4. **Verify and report** - Confirm success, suggest next steps

### Parameter Passing

**Simple parameters** - Use `$ARGUMENTS` for single input:
```bash
/innovation:new-idea This is the complete idea description
# $ARGUMENTS = "This is the complete idea description"
```

**Multiple parameters** - Use positional `$1`, `$2`, `$3`:
```bash
/knowledge:archive "Cost Dashboard" build
# $1 = "Cost Dashboard"
# $2 = "build"
```

**Default values** - Commands provide sensible defaults:
```bash
/cost:analyze
# Defaults to scope = "all"

/cost:analyze unused
# Overrides scope to "unused"
```

## Agent Integration

Commands delegate complex workflows to specialized agents from `.claude/agents/`:

- **@ideas-capture** - Innovation opportunity structuring
- **@cost-analyst** - Financial analysis and optimization
- **@archive-manager** - Lifecycle completion and knowledge preservation
- **@workflow-router** - Team assignment and workload balancing
- **@knowledge-curator** - Knowledge Vault curation
- **@build-architect** - Technical documentation and build structuring
- **@research-coordinator** - Research management and feasibility studies

Commands invoke agents using explicit syntax:
```markdown
Invoke @cost-analyst agent to execute comprehensive cost analysis:
1. Query Software Tracker...
2. Calculate spending metrics...
```

## Namespace Organization

Commands are organized by functional area in subdirectories:

```
.claude/commands/
├── innovation/     # Idea, research, build workflows
├── cost/           # Financial analysis and tracking
├── knowledge/      # Documentation and archival
└── team/           # Assignment and workload management
```

**Invocation syntax**: `/category:command-name`

Example: `/innovation:new-idea` executes `innovation/new-idea.md`

## Usage Examples

### Complete Innovation Lifecycle

```bash
# 1. Capture initial idea
/innovation:new-idea Automated cost tracking dashboard for software spend
# Output: Created idea with champion assignment, cost estimate, next steps

# 2. Start research
/innovation:start-research "Cost tracking automation feasibility" "Automated cost tracking dashboard"
# Output: Research entry with team, documentation links, cost tracking

# 3. Create build
/build:create "Cost Dashboard MVP" mvp
# Output: Build entry with GitHub link, technical docs, team assignments, total cost

# 4. Link software dependencies
/build:link-software "Cost Dashboard MVP" "Power BI,Azure SQL,GitHub"
# Output: Software linked with cost attribution and rollup calculations

# 5. Archive when complete
/knowledge:archive "Cost Dashboard MVP" build
# Output: Archived with Knowledge Vault entry, preserved links, learnings documented
```

### Quarterly Cost Review

```bash
# 1. Overall analysis
/cost:analyze
# Output: Total spend, top expenses, optimization opportunities, category breakdown

# 2. Find unused software
/cost:analyze unused
# Output: Tools with no active work, potential savings

# 3. Check expiring contracts
/cost:analyze expiring
# Output: Renewals needed in next 60 days, decision deadlines
```

### Team Workload Management

```bash
# 1. Assign new work
/team:assign "Azure OpenAI integration for Power BI" build
# Output: Recommended team member with rationale, workload status, alternatives

# 2. Check team workload (once implemented)
/team:workload
# Output: Full team distribution, overloaded members, recommendations
```

## Best Practices

### DO: Effective Command Usage

1. **Use consistent formatting** when passing parameters
   - Quote multi-word parameters: `/command "parameter with spaces"`
   - Provide complete context in descriptions

2. **Review command output** for next steps
   - Commands suggest follow-up actions
   - Look for cost impacts and optimization opportunities

3. **Leverage command chaining** for complete workflows
   - `/innovation:new-idea` → `/innovation:start-research` → `/innovation:create-build` → `/knowledge:archive`

4. **Check verification steps** to confirm success
   - Commands include validation queries
   - Use `/notion:search` to verify entries created

5. **Trust agent delegation**
   - Commands invoke specialized agents for complex workflows
   - Agents apply consistent patterns and brand voice

### DON'T: Common Mistakes

1. **Don't skip parameters** when required
   - Check `argument-hint` in `/help` for expected format
   - Use quotes for multi-word parameters

2. **Don't create duplicates**
   - Commands search existing content first
   - Review matches before proceeding

3. **Don't ignore cost implications**
   - Commands display cost impacts
   - Link software/tools for accurate tracking

4. **Don't forget to archive**
   - Use `/knowledge:archive` when work completes
   - Preserve learnings for future reference
