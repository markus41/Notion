# /monthly-spend - Total Monthly Software Spend Analysis

Analyze total monthly software spending across all active subscriptions to establish transparent cost visibility and drive informed budget decisions.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Query Software Tracker database
2. Filter WHERE Status = "Active"
3. Calculate: SUM(Total Monthly Cost) for all active entries
4. Group by:
   - Category (Development, Infrastructure, AI/ML, Analytics, etc.)
   - Microsoft Service (Azure, M365, Power Platform, GitHub, Dynamics, None)
   - Criticality (Critical, Important, Nice to Have)
5. Calculate percentages for each grouping
6. Identify top 5 most expensive tools
7. Show license utilization summary
```
