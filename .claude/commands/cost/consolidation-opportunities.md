# /consolidation-opportunities - Identify Tool Overlap & Consolidation Potential

Detect multiple tools serving similar purposes and recommend consolidation strategies to reduce complexity, lower costs, and streamline workflows through Microsoft ecosystem integration.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Query Software Tracker database
2. Filter WHERE Status = "Active"
3. Group tools by functionality patterns:
   - Category overlap (multiple tools in same category)
   - Description/purpose similarity analysis
   - User overlap (same team members using multiple similar tools)
4. For each potential consolidation:
   - Calculate combined current cost
   - Research Microsoft alternative
   - Estimate consolidated cost
   - Calculate savings potential
   - Assess migration complexity
5. Identify consolidation types:
   - DUPLICATE: Multiple tools doing exactly the same thing
   - OVERLAP: Tools with significant functional overlap
   - FRAGMENTATION: Similar needs spread across many tools
   - MICROSOFT OPPORTUNITY: Third-party tools replaceable by Microsoft services
6. Rank by savings potential and implementation feasibility
7. Calculate total consolidation savings
```
