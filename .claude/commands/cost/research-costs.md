# /research-costs - Research Thread Cost Analysis & Budget Tracking

Calculate comprehensive software costs for active research threads by aggregating all linked tools and services to provide transparent research budget visibility and support informed feasibility decisions.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Query Software Tracker database
2. For specified research thread (or all research if no argument):
   - Get all software linked to the Research Hub entry
   - For each linked software:
     - Get Total Monthly Cost (Cost Ã— License Count)
     - Get Annual Cost (Total Monthly Cost Ã— 12)
     - Get Criticality level
     - Get Category
     - Check if Microsoft Service
3. Calculate research-specific costs:
   - Total Monthly Cost = SUM(all linked software monthly costs)
   - Total Annual Cost = Total Monthly Ã— 12
4. Calculate research duration costs:
   - If research has started/completed dates, calculate total spent
   - If active, project remaining costs
5. Compare costs to:
   - Origin Idea costs
   - Viability Assessment (is research worth the cost?)
   - Potential build costs if research leads to prototype
6. Break down by category and service type
7. Identify optimization opportunities
