# /what-if-analysis - Budget Forecasting & Scenario Modeling

Model different software spending scenarios to forecast budget impact, evaluate strategic decisions, and support data-driven planning through comprehensive what-if cost analysis.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Query Software Tracker database for current baseline
2. Based on scenario type requested:
   - NEW_IDEA: Model adding software for a proposed idea/build
   - CANCEL: Model impact of canceling specific software
   - CONSOLIDATE: Model cost impact of consolidation strategy
   - MIGRATION: Model Microsoft ecosystem migration
   - GROWTH: Model team growth impact on licenses
   - OPTIMIZATION: Model combined optimization strategies
3. Calculate current state baseline
4. Apply scenario changes
5. Calculate new state after changes
6. Compare baseline vs scenario (delta analysis)
7. Project impacts over time (monthly, quarterly, annual)
8. Identify risks and dependencies
9. Recommend decision criteria
```
