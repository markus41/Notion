# /annual-projection - Annual Cost Projection & Trending

Project annual software costs based on current spend and identify trending patterns to support strategic budget planning and long-term financial sustainability.

## Calculation Logic

```
1. Query Software Tracker database
2. Filter WHERE Status = "Active"
3. Calculate current state:
   - Total Monthly = SUM(Total Monthly Cost)
   - Annual Projection = Total Monthly Ã— 12
4. Identify trending factors:
   - Trial subscriptions likely to convert
   - Contracts with known increases
   - Seasonal variations (if tracked)
5. Calculate adjusted projection:
   - Add: Trial â†’ Active conversions (Status = "Trial")
   - Add: Planned new software (Status = "Concept")
   - Subtract: Known cancellations (contracts ending, not renewing)
6. Compare to previous periods (if historical data available)
7. Calculate cost per team member (Total / 5 team members)
```

## Output Format

```
ðŸ“Š Annual Software Cost Projection

**Adjusted Annual Projection**: $XX,XXX
**Adjustment Factors**: +$X,XXX from trials, -$XXX from planned cancellations

**Cost per Team Member**: $X,XXX/year (based on 5 members)

### Budget Allocation Recommendation

**Critical Infrastructure** (XX% of total)
- Recommended allocation: $XX,XXX/year
- Current spend: $XX,XXX/year
- Status: [Under/Over/On Budget]

**Development & Innovation** (XX% of total)
- Recommended allocation: $XX,XXX/year
- Current spend: $XX,XXX/year
- Status: [Under/Over/On Budget]

**Productivity & Collaboration** (XX% of total)
- Recommended allocation: $XX,XXX/year
- Current spend: $XX,XXX/year
- Status: [Under/Over/On Budget]

**Strategic Recommendations**:
1. [Specific budget action based on trends]
2. [Consolidation or expansion recommendation]
3. [Risk mitigation for cost increases]

**Next Steps**:
- Run `/what-if-analysis` to model different scenarios
- Run `/consolidation-opportunities` to identify potential savings
- Review trials with `/expiring-contracts 30` for pending decisions
