# Frame 1: Daily Operations Summary (Deck)

**Frame Type**: Deck (Executive Summary Slide Deck)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Category**: Operations Reporting
**Target Users**: DSP Operations Managers, OTR Area Managers
**Frequency**: Daily (1x per day, typically end-of-shift)
**Estimated Time Savings**: 80-85% (30-45 min ‚Üí 5-8 min)

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: DSP Operations Managers and OTR Area Managers spend 30-45 minutes daily compiling operational performance summaries from multiple systems (WST, Netradyne, AMZL dashboards, incident logs). This manual aggregation is:
- ‚ùå Time-consuming (30-45 min daily √ó 260 workdays = 130-195 hours/year per manager)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent (varying formats across managers)
- ‚ùå Error-prone (manual data entry from multiple sources)
- ‚ùå Delayed (often completed 2-4 hours after shift end)

**Pain Points**:
- Juggling 5-7 different systems to gather metrics
- Copying/pasting data into PowerPoint or email
- Forgetting to include critical incidents or exceptions
- Missing leadership deadlines for daily reporting
- No standardized format for cross-station comparisons

**User Quotes** (from user research):
> "I spend the last hour of my shift clicking through systems to build my daily report. By the time I send it, leadership has already moved on to the next issue." ‚Äî DSP Operations Manager, 3 years experience

> "Every Area Manager formats their daily summary differently. When I review 10 stations, I can't compare apples to apples." ‚Äî Regional Operations Director

### Step 3: AI Processing (Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo)
**Duration**: 15-30 seconds
**System Prompt** (embedded in Frame):

```
You are an operations reporting assistant for Amazon Logistics (AMZL) delivery station operations.
Generate a concise, executive-ready 5-slide summary deck based on the operational data provided.

BRAND VOICE: Professional, data-driven, action-oriented (Brookside BI standards)
AUDIENCE: Station leadership, regional operations managers, executive stakeholders
FORMAT: PowerPoint-ready slide content (bullet points, not paragraphs)

For each slide:
1. Executive Summary: Highlight the most critical metrics and 3 wins + 3 challenges
2. Performance Metrics: Show trends (‚Üë‚Üì) vs. yesterday and weekly average
3. Safety & Compliance: Flag any RED items requiring immediate action
4. Operational Exceptions: Prioritize by impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. Next-Day Priorities: Actionable items with owners assigned

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use percentages with 1 decimal place (e.g., 94.7% DCR)
- Flag metrics below target with ‚ö†Ô∏è symbol
- Highlight improvements with ‚úÖ symbol
- Keep bullets to 8-10 words max (concise, scannable)
- Include specific numbers (not "many routes" but "12 routes")
- Identify root causes for exceptions (not just symptoms)
- Suggest corrective actions for each challenge
```

**Processing Steps**:
1. Query WST API for route performance data
2. Fetch Netradyne alerts for safety incidents
3. Aggregate RTS volume and reasons from tracking system
4. Retrieve incident reports from incident management system
5. Calculate performance trends (day-over-day, week-over-week)
6. Apply Frame structure to organize data into 5 slides
7. Generate slide content with brand voice and formatting
8. Insert data visualizations (simple charts for trends)

### Step 4: Output Review & Refinement
**System Response**: Displays slide preview in Teams or email
**User Options**:
- ‚úÖ Approve and send (auto-distributes to leadership distribution list)
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit specific slides (opens in PowerPoint for manual adjustments)
- üîÑ Regenerate with different focus (e.g., "emphasize safety incidents")
- üíæ Save as draft for later review

**Default Distribution** (if approved):
- Email to: [Station Manager, Regional Ops Manager, Business Coach]
- Post to: [Station Operations Teams channel]
- Archive to: [SharePoint Daily Reports library]

### Step 5: Feedback Collection
**Post-Execution Survey** (embedded in email):
- Rating: "How useful was this summary?" [1-5 stars]
- Time saved: "How much time did this save you?" [0-15 min | 15-30 min | 30-60 min | 60+ min]
- Accuracy: "Were all critical issues included?" [Yes / No ‚Üí specify what's missing]
- Suggestions: "What would improve this Frame?" [Free text, optional]

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### From Builder Button MVP
1. **Start Simple**: 5-slide deck is easier to adopt than 10-slide comprehensive report
2. **Invisible Training**: Frame name "Daily Operations Summary" is self-explanatory
3. **Quick Wins**: Focus on time savings (30 min ‚Üí 5 min) as primary value prop
4. **User Ownership**: Let users customize before sending (builds trust in AI output)

### From User Research
1. **Data Source Reliability**: API failures are the #1 user complaint ‚Üí build robust retry logic
2. **Formatting Matters**: Bullet points > paragraphs for executive consumption
3. **Context is Critical**: Including "why" (root cause) matters more than "what" (the metric)
4. **Recognition Opportunity**: Highlighting "Top 3 wins" boosts morale and engagement
