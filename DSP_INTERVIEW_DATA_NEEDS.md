**Interview Date**: 2025-10-24
**Interviewer**: Markus Ahling
**Expected Duration**: 45-60 minutes

## üéØ Priority 1: Cortex UI & Data Structure (CRITICAL)

### Screenshots Needed

- [ ] Individual route detail page
- [ ] Driver progress view (real-time updates)
- [ ] Rescue assignment interface
- [ ] VTO management screen (if exists in Cortex)
- [ ] Scorecard/metrics dashboard

### Data Format Questions
1. **Route Data Structure**:
   - What is the exact format of route codes? (e.g., "DLA9-CX-1" or different pattern?)
   - How many routes typically assigned per day at a Sacramento station?
   - What data points are visible for each route?
     - Driver name
     - Total stops
     - Completed stops
     - Package count
     - Current location (latitude/longitude)
     - Status indicators
     - Estimated completion time

2. **Driver Progress Tracking**:
   - How often does Cortex refresh driver progress? (30 seconds? 1 minute?)
   - What triggers "behind schedule" calculations?
   - What metrics determine Green (0-1 behind) vs. Yellow (2-5) vs. Red (6+)?
   - Is there a "packages per hour" benchmark visible?

3. **Real-Time Location**:
   - Does Cortex show driver location on a map?
   - What mapping service does Amazon use?
   - How accurate are the location pins?

### Sample Data Request

## üîÑ Priority 2: VTO (Voluntary Time Off) Workflow

### Process Documentation Needed
1. **Current VTO Flow**:
   - How does a DSP owner initiate VTO offer?
   - How are drivers notified? (Text? App? Amazon Flex?)
   - What is the acceptance window? (e.g., "Accept within 30 minutes")
   - What happens after driver accepts VTO?
     - Route reassignment process
     - ADP/Paycom logging
     - Replacement driver assignment

2. **ADP Integration Points**:
   - What specific data syncs to ADP when VTO is accepted?
   - Is it automatic or manual entry?
   - What shows up on driver's timecard in ADP?

3. **VTO Scenarios**:
   - Typical VTO acceptance rate (percentage)
   - How often is VTO offered? (Daily? Weekly?)
   - Peak times for VTO (slow days, weather delays)
   - Replacement assignment logic (first available? best performer? geographic proximity?)

### Screenshots/Examples
