This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Brookside BI Innovation Nexus** - An innovation management system designed to establish structured approaches for tracking ideas from concept through research, building, and knowledge archival. This solution is designed for managing innovation workflow using Notion as the central hub with future Microsoft ecosystem integrations.

**Repository Purpose**: Streamline key workflows for innovation management through:
- Notion workspace management via MCP integration
- Future code integrations with Microsoft ecosystem (Azure, GitHub, SharePoint, Teams)
- Documentation generation and knowledge management
- Cost analysis and optimization for software/tools

## Core Architecture

### Innovation Workflow

```
üí° Idea (Concept)
  ‚Üì (if Needs Research)
üî¨ Research (Active) ‚Üí Viability Assessment
  ‚Üì (if Next Steps = Build Example)
üõ†Ô∏è Example Build (Active) ‚Üí Lessons Learned
  ‚Üì (when Complete)
üìö Knowledge Vault (Archived for Reference)
```

**Design Principles**:
- Status-driven, not timeline-driven: Active | Not Active | Concept | Archived
- Viability over deadlines: High | Medium | Low | Needs Research
- Every build is for learning - archive everything for future reference
- Cost transparency is critical - track all software/tool expenses
- Microsoft-first ecosystem - prioritize Microsoft solutions
- Agentic development - all technical documentation structured for AI agents

### Notion Database Architecture

The workspace consists of 7 interconnected databases:

1. **üí° Ideas Registry** - Innovation starting point
   - Status: Concept | Active | Not Active | Archived
   - Viability: High | Medium | Low | Needs Research
   - Relations: Research Hub, Example Builds, Software Tracker
   - Key Rollup: Estimated Cost (from linked software)

2. **üî¨ Research Hub** - Feasibility investigation
   - Status: Concept | Active | Not Active | Completed
   - Viability Assessment: Highly Viable | Moderately Viable | Not Viable | Inconclusive
   - Next Steps: Build Example | More Research | Archive | Abandon
   - Relations: Ideas Registry, Software Tracker

3. **üõ†Ô∏è Example Builds** - Working prototypes/demos
   - Status: Concept | Active | Not Active | Completed | Archived

   - Reusability: Highly Reusable | Partially Reusable | One-Off
   - Relations: Ideas Registry, Research Hub, Software Tracker, Knowledge Vault
   - Key Rollup: Total Cost (from linked software)

4. **üí∞ Software & Cost Tracker** - Financial hub (central cost source)
   - Status: Active | Trial | Inactive | Cancelled
   - Category: Development | Infrastructure | Productivity | Analytics | Communication | Security | Storage | AI/ML | Design
   - Microsoft Service: Azure | M365 | Power Platform | GitHub | Dynamics | None
   - Formulas: Total Monthly Cost = Cost √ó License Count, Annual Cost = Cost √ó 12
   - Relations FROM: All other databases

5. **üìö Knowledge Vault** - Archived learnings
   - Status: Draft | Published | Deprecated | Archived
   - Content Type: Tutorial | Case Study | Technical Doc | Process | Template | Post-Mortem | Reference
   - Evergreen/Dated: Categorizes longevity
   - Relations: Ideas, Research, Builds, Software Tracker

6. **üîó Integration Registry** - System connections
   - Integration Type: API | Webhook | Database | File Sync | Automation | Embed
   - Authentication Method: Azure AD | Service Principal | API Key | OAuth
   - Security Review Status: Approved | Pending | N/A
   - Relations: Software Tracker, Example Builds

7. **üéØ OKRs & Strategic Initiatives** - Alignment tracker
   - Status: Concept | Active | Not Active | Completed
   - Progress %: 0-100
   - Relations: Ideas Registry, Example Builds

**Database IDs**: After authenticating Notion MCP (restart Claude Code), query the workspace to document actual database IDs for programmatic access.

## Notion MCP Commands

### Authentication Setup

```bash
# Notion MCP is configured in .claude.json
# Restart Claude Code to activate authentication
claude mcp list  # Verify authentication status
```

### Standard Operations Protocol

**ALWAYS follow this search-first protocol:**

```
BEFORE creating anything:
1. Search for existing content (avoid duplicates)
2. Fetch related items to understand current structure
3. Check existing relations
4. Propose action to user
5. Execute with proper linking
```

### Common MCP Operations

**Search for existing content:**
```bash
# Search by query
notion-search "query text"

# Fetch specific page/database
notion-fetch "page-url-or-id"
```

**Creating Ideas:**
```
1. Search Ideas Registry for duplicates
2. Create entry with:
   - Status = "Concept" (default)
   - Viability = "Needs Research" or user-specified
   - Champion = Assigned based on team member specialization
   - Innovation Type = Appropriate category
   - Effort = Estimate (XS/S/M/L/XL)
   - Impact Score = 1-10 rating
3. Link related software from Software Tracker
4. Create relations to similar ideas if found
5. Prompt for next steps: Research needed? Build directly?
```

**Creating Research Entries:**
```
1. Create Research Hub entry with:
   - Status = "Active"
   - Link to originating Idea (required)
   - Hypothesis = Clear statement
   - Methodology = Approach description
   - Researchers = Team members
2. Link all software/tools being used
3. Set up SharePoint/OneNote links for detailed docs
4. Remind about final outputs:
   - Key Findings
   - Viability Assessment
   - Next Steps selection
```

**Creating Example Builds:**
```
1. Create Example Build entry with:
   - Status = "Active"
   - Build Type = Prototype/POC/Demo/MVP/Reference
   - Link to Origin Idea (required)
   - Link to Related Research (if exists)
   - Lead Builder = Assigned team member
   - Core Team = Supporting members
2. Get GitHub repo URL
3. Link ALL software/tools used (for cost rollup)
4. Set Reusability assessment
5. Create nested documentation page with:
   - Technical architecture (AI-agent friendly)
   - Setup instructions
   - API documentation
   - Configuration details
6. Prompt for Azure DevOps link, Teams channel
```

**Adding Software/Tools:**
```
1. Check if software exists in Software Tracker
2. If new, create entry with:
   - Cost = Monthly amount (normalize annual to monthly)
   - License Count = Number of seats
   - Status = Active/Trial/Inactive/Cancelled
   - Category = Appropriate classification
   - Microsoft Service = Mark if applicable
   - Owner = Responsible person
   - Users = All users
   - Authentication Method = How team accesses
   - Criticality = Critical/Important/Nice to Have
3. Auto-calculated formulas:
   - Total Monthly Cost = Cost √ó License Count
   - Annual Cost = Cost √ó 12
4. Show user: "This will add $X/month to your costs"
```

**Cost Analysis Operations:**
```python
# Total monthly spend
sum(Software Tracker where Status = "Active", field = "Total Monthly Cost")

# Annual projection
total_monthly √ó 12

# Top 5 most expensive
sort(Software Tracker by "Total Monthly Cost", desc, limit=5)

# Unused tools (optimization opportunity)
filter(Software Tracker where:
    relation_count(Ideas) = 0 AND
    relation_count(Research) = 0 AND
    relation_count(Builds) = 0
)

# Expiring contracts
filter(Software Tracker where:
    Contract End Date within 60 days AND
    Status = "Active"
)
```

**Archiving Protocol:**
```
When user says "archive this":
1. Update Status ‚Üí "Archived" or "Not Active"
2. Check for documented learnings:
   - Ideas: Final viability assessment
   - Research: Key findings recorded
   - Builds: Lessons learned captured
3. Create Knowledge Vault entry if valuable:
   - Content Type = Post-Mortem or Case Study
   - Link to archived item
   - Evergreen/Dated = Assess longevity
4. Verify all links preserved:
   - GitHub repos still accessible
   - SharePoint/OneNote locations recorded
   - Software/tools still linked for cost tracking
5. Update any dependent items
```

### Code Integration Development

When building code integrations, follow these standards:

**Agentic Development Principles:**

1. **No Ambiguity**: Every instruction should be executable by an AI agent without human interpretation
2. **Explicit Versions**: Always specify exact versions of dependencies
3. **Idempotent Steps**: Setup steps should be runnable multiple times safely
4. **Environment Aware**: Clearly separate dev/staging/prod configurations
5. **Error Handling**: Document expected errors and how to resolve them
6. **Verification Steps**: Include commands to verify each setup step succeeded
7. **Rollback Procedures**: Document how to undo changes if deployment fails
8. **Secret Management**: Never hardcode secrets, always reference Key Vault or env vars
9. **Schema First**: Define data models before implementation
10. **Test Coverage**: Include test commands and expected results

### Technical Documentation Structure

When creating technical documentation for builds, structure for AI agent consumption:

```markdown

### Database View Requirements

**Every database must include:**
- "By Status" view (grouped by Status)
- "Active" view (filtered to Status = Active)
- For Software Tracker: Always show cost columns
- For Builds: Always show Reusability indicator

## Proactive Patterns & Alerts

### Pattern Detection

**When you notice:**
- 3+ ideas related to same topic ‚Üí Suggest consolidation or research thread
- Build not updated to Completed ‚Üí Ask if it's finished
- Software mentioned but not in tracker ‚Üí Add it
- High viability research with no build ‚Üí Suggest prototyping
- Multiple builds using same expensive tool ‚Üí Suggest consolidation
- Software with no active relations ‚Üí Flag for potential removal
- Expiring contracts within 30 days ‚Üí Alert user
- Valuable build with no Knowledge Vault entry ‚Üí Suggest documentation
- Team member overloaded (too many Active items) ‚Üí Suggest reprioritization

### Cost Optimization Alerts

```
"These 3 builds all use [software] - could consolidate to save costs"
"[Software] costs $X/month but isn't linked to any active work - still needed?"
"Contract for [software] expires in [N] days - time to review?"
"Found [N] tools doing similar things - consolidation could save $X/month"
```

## Critical Rules

### ‚ùå Never Do This

- Create without searching for duplicates first
- Create builds without linking origin ideas
- Add software without cost information
- Skip linking software to builds/research/ideas
- Archive without documenting lessons learned
- Suggest non-Microsoft solutions without checking Microsoft offerings first
- Set Status = Active without user confirmation
- Ignore cost rollups - always verify software links
- Use timeline or deadline language ("due date", "week 1", "by Friday")
- Skip Brookside BI branding on major pages
- Create ambiguous technical documentation
- Hardcode secrets or credentials in any documentation

### ‚úÖ Always Do This

- Search before creating (every time)
- Fetch existing content for context
- Create proper relations between databases
- Link ALL software/tools used
- Maintain status fields accurately
- Document viability assessments
- Suggest Knowledge Vault entries for completed work
- Track costs transparently with rollups
- Use consistent emojis and formatting
- Prioritize Microsoft ecosystem solutions
- Check for reusability opportunities
- Consider team specializations when assigning
- Structure technical docs for AI agents
- Provide explicit, executable instructions
- Include verification steps in all procedures

### Recommended Settings for This Repository

Create or edit `.claude/settings.local.json` with these productivity enhancements:

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "cleanupPeriodDays": 90,
  "includeCoAuthoredBy": true,
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo -e '\\a'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo -e '\\a'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(claude mcp add:*)",
      "Bash(claude mcp list:*)",
      "Read(C:/Users/MarkusAhling/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**What these settings do:**
- **model**: Uses latest Sonnet 4.5 for optimal performance
- **cleanupPeriodDays**: Extends chat history retention to 90 days for innovation tracking
- **includeCoAuthoredBy**: Maintains Claude attribution in commits per brand guidelines
- **hooks.Notification**: Triggers terminal bell when Claude needs attention
- **hooks.Stop**: Triggers terminal bell when Claude finishes processing
- **permissions.allow**: Pre-approves Notion MCP commands and file access

### Terminal Notification Setup

**For Windows Terminal / PowerShell:**
```bash
# No additional setup needed - bell character works natively
```

**For iTerm2 (macOS):**
```bash
# Open iTerm2 ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Terminal
# Enable "Silence bell"
# Set "Filter Alerts" to "Send escape sequence-generated alerts"
```

**For VS Code Integrated Terminal:**
```bash
# Configure via /terminal-setup command in Claude Code
# Or add to VS Code settings.json:
"terminal.integrated.bellDuration": 1000
```

### Additional Useful Settings

Add these to your settings file as needed:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "NOTION_WORKSPACE_ID": "81686779-099a-8195-b49e-00037e25c23e"
  },
  "outputStyle": "Apply Brookside BI brand voice: professional, solution-focused, consultative.",
  "alwaysThinkingEnabled": true
}
```

**Note**: The `env.NOTION_WORKSPACE_ID` is already configured in the global `.claude.json`, so you don't need to add it to settings unless overriding.

## Notes for Claude Code Agents

This project establishes scalable infrastructure for innovation management:

- **Notion is source of truth** for all innovation tracking
- **Cost tracking is critical** - never skip linking software/tools
- **Microsoft ecosystem is default** - always check Microsoft solutions first
- **Status over timelines** - focus on viability and progress, not deadlines
- **Archive liberally** - every completed build becomes reference material
- **Relations create value** - database connections enable cost rollups and context
- **Team specializations matter** - respect expertise when assigning work
- **Technical docs for AI agents** - all builds should be executable by future AI agents
- **Brand consistency** - apply Brookside BI voice to all outputs

**Remember**: You're building an innovation engine designed to streamline workflows and drive measurable outcomes through structured approaches. Focus on learning, reusability, cost transparency, and knowledge capture to support sustainable growth.
