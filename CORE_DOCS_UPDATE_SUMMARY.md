## Remaining Gaps & Future Updates

### Low Priority (Can Be Addressed Later)

1. **Azure Portal Links**: Several placeholders remain in CLAUDE.md:
   - "Azure Portal: [Portal link to be configured]" (Line 303)
   - "SharePoint Site: [Root site URL to be configured]" (Line 304)
   - "Teams Channels: [Team channels to be configured]" (Line 305)
   - "Power BI Workspace: [Workspace URL to be configured]" (Line 306)

   **Recommendation**: These should be populated when actual resources are provisioned and URLs become available.

2. **README Badges**: Currently using placeholder badge links. Consider adding:
   - Actual build status badge when CI/CD is configured
   - Version badge when versioning scheme is established
   - Test coverage badge when testing infrastructure is implemented

3. **Contributing Guidelines**: README.md mentions contribution standards but no dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md file exists.

   **Recommendation**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md if open-source contributions are desired in the future.

4. **License File**: README.md references MIT License but verifies LICENSE file exists.

   **Recommendation**: Confirm LICENSE file is present and accurate.

### No Action Required (By Design)

1. **Brookside Repository Analyzer Documentation**: This subdirectory project maintains its own README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md. Parent repository CLAUDE.md already includes comprehensive section about the analyzer (Lines 2748-2913). No duplication needed.

2. **MCP Server Configuration**: While `.claude.json` contains MCP server configurations, CLAUDE.md already documents all 4 servers comprehensively. No separate MCP configuration guide needed.

3. **Environment Variable Template**: `.env.example` file is referenced but CLAUDE.md already documents all required environment variables. Verify `.env.example` exists and is current.
