# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation that has been consolidated to streamline the repository structure.

## Purpose

Establish a sustainable documentation structure by archiving completed phase reports, implementation summaries, and session notes while preserving all historical context for future reference.

**Best for**: Organizations requiring access to historical implementation details, completed phase documentation, and project archaeology.

## Deprecation Policy

Files are moved to this archive when:
- ✅ Phase or project is completed
- ✅ Documentation is historical/reference-only
- ✅ Content has been consolidated into active docs
- ✅ File was a one-time deliverable (session summary, analysis report)

Files remain in active locations when:
- ⚠️ Actively maintained and updated
- ⚠️ Part of ongoing operations (troubleshooting guides, configuration docs)
- ⚠️ Essential for day-to-day workflows

---

## Preservation Guarantee

**All archived content is preserved indefinitely** - no files are deleted during consolidation. If you need historical context or want to understand how decisions were made, this archive provides complete project archaeology.
