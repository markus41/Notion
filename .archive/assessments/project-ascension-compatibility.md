## Agent Compatibility Matrix

### Category 1: Overlapping Agents (3 agents - Versioning Required)

| Agent | Innovation Nexus | Project-Ascension | Recommended Strategy |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **architect-supreme** | 23.8 KB<br>Innovation-focused architecture<br>Notion workflows, cost decisions | 14.4 KB<br>Enterprise patterns<br>Distributed systems, CAP theorem | **KEEP BOTH WITH VERSIONING**<br>Standard: Innovation management context<br>`-pa`: Complex distributed systems |
| **database-architect** | 15.7 KB<br>Notion schema optimization<br>Azure SQL basics | 12.8 KB<br>Multi-database expertise<br>Postgres, MongoDB, Cassandra | **KEEP BOTH WITH VERSIONING**<br>Standard: Notion-focused database design<br>`-pa`: Multi-database enterprise patterns |
| **compliance-orchestrator** | 21.8 KB<br>Software licensing focus<br>Integration Registry security | 13.9 KB<br>GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2<br>Regulatory compliance | **KEEP BOTH WITH VERSIONING**<br>Standard: Software licensing, costs<br>`-pa`: Regulatory frameworks |

**Integration Approach**: Rename Project-Ascension versions with `-pa` suffix (e.g., `architect-supreme-pa.md`). Preserve Innovation Nexus versions as primary. Add "When to Use" guidance to each version.

**Rationale**: Both versions provide unique value. Innovation Nexus versions optimize for innovation management and Notion workflows. Project-Ascension versions provide deeper enterprise architecture and regulatory expertise. Teams can choose context-appropriate guidance.
