### 3. Implementation Guide: README-NOTION-DOCUMENTATION.md

**Purpose**: Step-by-step instructions for creating Notion entries manually

**Contents**:
- ‚úÖ Overview of all files
- ‚úÖ Prerequisites (access, database IDs)
- ‚úÖ **Detailed step-by-step instructions** for each entry
- ‚úÖ Property configuration guide
- ‚úÖ Software linking instructions
- ‚úÖ Tag setup
- ‚úÖ Verification checklists
- ‚úÖ Post-creation tasks (cross-linking, updates)
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting common issues
- ‚úÖ Time estimates (45-60 minutes total)

**Workflow for Each Entry**:
1. Open target database
2. Create new page
3. Set all properties
4. Copy markdown content
5. Link to Software Tracker
6. Add tags
7. Verify and publish

---

## Why Manual Entry (Not Automated)

**Current Limitation**: Notion MCP tools are not directly available in the current Claude Code environment.

**Manual Process Ensures**:
- ‚úÖ Proper formatting in Notion's rich text editor
- ‚úÖ Correct property assignments
- ‚úÖ Accurate software relations
- ‚úÖ Human review before publishing
- ‚úÖ Flexibility to adjust as needed

**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes to create both entries manually

---

## How to Create Entries in Notion

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

**Step 1**: Open the implementation guide
```
File: notion-entries/README-NOTION-DOCUMENTATION.md
```

**Step 2**: Follow detailed instructions for each entry
- Phase 3 Build: Steps 1-7 (20-25 minutes)
- Repository Hooks: Steps 1-9 (15-20 minutes)

**Step 3**: Verify both entries with checklists provided

**That's it!** The guide walks you through every detail.

## What You'll Need

### Notion Access

- [x] Access to Brookside BI workspace
- [x] Write permissions to Example Builds database
- [x] Write permissions to Knowledge Vault database (or create it)
- [x] Access to Software & Cost Tracker for linking

### Database IDs (From CLAUDE.md)

```
Example Builds: a1cd1528-971d-4873-a176-5e93b93555f6
Software & Cost Tracker: 13b5e9de-2dd1-45ec-839a-4f3d50cd8d06
Knowledge Vault: [Search in Notion or create new database]
```

### Time

- 45-60 minutes for both entries
- Can be split across multiple sessions
- Faster if Software Tracker already has all tools

---

## File Locations
