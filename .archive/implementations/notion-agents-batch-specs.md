## ðŸš€ Batch Creation Workflow

### Option 1: Manual Batch Creation (Recommended for First Pass)

**Time Estimate**: 3-5 hours for all 47 entries

**Process**:
1. Open Notion Example Builds database
2. For each agent/command (use inventory tables above):
   - Click "New" to create entry
   - Copy title from inventory table
   - Fill in template fields (Status, Build Type, etc.)
   - Copy description from source .md file (first paragraph)
   - Add technical specifications
   - Link to Software Tracker: Claude Code
   - Add tags from category
   - Save entry
3. Verify all 47 entries created
4. Spot-check 5-10 entries for consistency

### Option 2: Automated Batch Creation (When Notion MCP Reconnects)

**Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes

**Process**:
```bash
# Use Claude Code with Notion MCP to bulk create entries
"Create all 23 agent entries in Example Builds database using the agent template
from NOTION_AGENTS_COMMANDS_BATCH_SPECS.md and source files from .claude/agents/"

"Create all 24 command entries in Example Builds database using the command template
from NOTION_AGENTS_COMMANDS_BATCH_SPECS.md and source files from .claude/commands/"
```

## âœ… Verification Checklist

After batch creation, verify:

- [ ] **Count**: 47 total entries (23 agents + 24 commands)
- [ ] **Naming**: All titles follow format (ðŸ¤– @agent or âš¡ /command)
- [ ] **Status**: All marked "Active"
- [ ] **Build Type**: All marked "Reference Implementation"
- [ ] **Viability**: All marked "Production Ready"
- [ ] **Reusability**: All marked "Highly Reusable"
- [ ] **Software Links**: All link to "Claude Code" in Software Tracker
- [ ] **Tags**: All have appropriate category tags
- [ ] **Documentation**: All reference correct source .md files
- [ ] **Search**: Test search for "agents", "commands", "@", "/" to verify discoverability
